# jcodemunch-mcp — Project Brief

## Current State
- **Version:** 1.108.317 — **CI runs the harness on every change; publishing is a dispatched workflow.** Eight workflows are five (`pr-gate.yml`, `main.yml`, `nightly.yml`, `security.yml`, `release.yml`); every PR-gate job is a REQUIRED check on `main` by name; `enforce_admins` and `strict` are ON; a release is `release.yml` dispatched with a version, Test PyPI first, trusted publishing, post-publish smoke on both OSes. ⚠⚠ **The gate caught its own author four times before it merged** (unformatted scripts, a subprocess without `encoding=`, invalid YAML in `release.yml` found by CodeQL, a venv path uv cannot resolve on windows) and the release pre-flight was wrong twice about a MAIN commit (C-13, C-14: the PR gate's jobs live on the PR's merge ref; the witnesses on main are `main.yml`'s). ⚠ Windows runners are 3x this box on the full tier: a platform-scoped Floor `suite.full_seconds_ci_windows`, not a loosening. ⚠ Also in this release: tied `search_symbols` scores rank by symbol id (harness F-13), the token reference is captured on CI, `types.error_max` and `deps.vuln_max` Floors, `SECURITY.md` reporting policy. Forensics: `docs/cicd/`. [[the-cicd-pipeline-lives-in-docs-cicd]]
- **Prior (1.108.316):** **A display preference edited the data it was displaying** (#572, @rknighton): the shared result cache handed back its stored dict, so `meta_fields` (the SHIPPED default `[]`) and per-call `suppress_meta` rewrote what every later caller was served; fixed in the cache, not at the two call sites. Rules: Key Files `storage/token_tracker.py`; forensics: `ISSUE-HISTORY.md` (rotated 2026-09-04).
- **Prior (1.108.315):** **A fix for a false positive can install a false negative** (#569, #566): `encoding/schemas/` is enumerated at import time, so twelve live encoders published as dead at confidence 1.0, and the first draft of the fix revived 502 files under `tests/` with every assertion green; `check_delete_safe` certified the deletes regardless. Rules: Key Files `tools/_runtime_discovery.py`, `tools/_corpus_adequacy.py`, `tools/check_delete_safe.py`; forensics: `ISSUE-HISTORY.md` (rotated 2026-09-04).
- **Older releases (1.108.314 and earlier):** see `CHANGELOG.md` (1.108.303-.310 and 1.108.314 in `ISSUE-HISTORY.md`). The 1.108.182 entry ("a stall has a name and a ceiling", #375) and the 1.108.177-.181 #377 hardening arc are there in full.
- **Tests:** 9241 passed, 19 skipped, **0 failed** (1.108.317, `uv run pytest -n auto`; the skip count is 19 under `uv run` and 13 under `PYTHONPATH=src python -m pytest`, harness F-05) **+ `uv run ruff check src/` clean**, measured on the settled tree after the bump and the rotation. ⚠ **9260 TOTAL, +86 over the .316 line's 9174**: the CI/CD series' guard tests (`test_workflows_pinned`, `test_harness_summary`, `test_security_md_policy`, `test_release_preflight`, `test_search_symbols_tie_order`) plus the harness build's. ⚠ Prior (1.108.316): 9161 passed, 13 skipped, **0 failed** (9174 total **+ `uv run ruff check src/` clean**, measured on the settled tree after the bump and the rotation. ⚠ **9174 TOTAL, +26 over the .315 line's 9148**, and it reconciles EXACTLY: 11 from this release's `tests/test_result_cache_isolation.py`, 2 from @rknighton's merged #570, 7 from #571's `test_kind_enum_is_derived.py`, 5 from `test_savings_usd_basis.py` and 1 from the holdout-artifact gate — four of those five shipped between the two measurements. ⚠ **A delta is only readable when both ends name the same tree**; three commits sat between these two. ⚠ `ruff check tests/` reports 292 PRE-EXISTING errors and is NOT this project's gate; `src/` is. ⚠⚠ **THE ROTATION IS TWO EDITS, NOT ONE** — moving a release out of Current State also moves the "Older releases (X and earlier)" boundary, and `test_claude_md_rotation.py` fails naming both numbers; it caught .311's settled run at `1 failed`. ⚠⚠ **READ THE SKIP COUNT, NOT JUST THE EXIT CODE AND THE TOTAL** — a .305 reproduce came back exit 0 with the total reconciling exactly while 105 tests silently did not execute. Forensics and the correct command: **Reproducing CI's environment**. ⚠⚠ **Compare TOTALS, never passed counts, and NEVER a skip count ACROSS machines** — CI ubuntu skips 26 and windows 19 where this box skips 13, all pre-existing; **the before/after delta on the SAME job is the only signal**. ⚠⚠ **A BACKGROUND-TASK BANNER SAYING "exit code 0" IS NOT A GREEN SUITE** — one run reported exit 0 having never started pytest (`--timeout` plugin absent), and .306 had a banner say exit 0 over a log whose own `EXIT=` line said 1. **Redirect the exit code INTO the log (`{ pytest; echo "EXIT=$?"; } > log`) and grep that line**; a bare `&` does not survive the shell either. ⚠⚠ **A CONTRIBUTOR PR IS TRIAL-MERGED ONTO `main` AND RUN LOCALLY BEFORE THE MERGE** — branch-green is not merged-green and the merge base moves every release. ⚠⚠ **A reproduce that ERRORS in `tests/test_sdist_exclusions.py` is NOT environmental noise** — that file is the sdist CREDENTIAL-LEAK guard (v0.2.6), and it errors at setup when the scratch venv must fetch the build backend with DNS blocked. Re-run it explicitly; never wave it through. ⚠ Prior (1.108.315): 9135 passed, 13 skipped, **0 failed** (9148 total). ⚠ Prior (1.108.314): 9108 total. ⚠ Two full runs contend on the same `~/.code-index` process-lock scopes, the documented cause of .261's 47m outlier, so the 3.13 reproduce runs AFTER the local suite, never beside it.
- **Python:** >=3.10
- **Tool count:** 91 visible in `full` / 94 in catalog (front door hidden; counts verified 2026-07-30 from `jcodemunch-mcp surface`, which is the only place to get them — do NOT hand-type this; +1 v1.108.111 `get_parity_map`, +1 v1.108.112 `get_decorator_census`, +1 v1.108.113 `get_architecture_metrics`); `tool_surface=counter` exposes a 3-tool front door (`order`/`menu`/`route`) instead

## How work is done here (2026-09-04)

**Use these; do not improvise the process.** Each one runs the harness at
the right moments, spawns an independent reviewer, and produces the
Definition-of-Done checklist itself (`.claude/hooks/dod_checklist.py`), so
a step cannot be skipped by forgetting it.
`/feature <desc>` · `/fix-issue <n>` · `/release` · `/benchmark-compare [ref]`
· `/review [pr|ref] [--merge-check]` · `/triage-issue <n>` ·
`/competitive-compare [tool] [ref]` (the competitive tier against a ref; drafts to `.claude/state/competitive/`, never the ledger).
Authority, never restated in a command: `docs/standard/STANDARD.md` (what
good means; the Definition of Done), `docs/harness/ARCHAEOLOGY.md` (why every
test exists), `docs/cicd/RUNBOOK.md` (what a human does),
`docs/workflows/DESIGN.md` (what each command does, step by step; §8 is how
to add one). ⚠ Hooks (`.claude/hooks/`, wired in `.claude/settings.json`)
refuse a `git commit` that fails the fast tier, a `gh pr create` without a
full-tier run on THIS tree, and every publish, tag, merge or posting verb;
those lines are handed to the human in cmd.exe form. ⚠⚠ **`.claude/` is
TRACKED as of 2026-09-04** except `settings.local.json`, `*.bak` and
`state/`; the sdist still excludes all of it (the v0.2.6 vector), asserted by
`tests/test_build.py`, `tests/test_sdist_exclusions.py` and
`tests/test_workflows_registered.py`. Open findings: `docs/workflows/FINDINGS.md`.

## Inbound: headless work on issues and PRs (2026-09-04)

**`docs/inbound/POLICY.md` is what a headless job may do; `DESIGN.md` is
each job; `docs/cicd/RUNBOOK.md` section 9 is what a human does.** Nine
`inbound-*.yml` workflows (DESIGN names each). ⚠⚠
**Nothing runs until the variable `INBOUND_ENABLED` reads exactly
`true`**; absent is OFF, read first and again before every first write.
⚠⚠ **The model never holds a token that can write**: model jobs run on
the read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` and write a file; a no-model job verifies it
and writes with the App, to be confined by a ruleset to `inbound/**` and
`inbound-ledger` (RUNBOOK 9's once-only setup). Nothing headless merges, tags, publishes, closes, or
touches POLICY 4.4's never-touch list (this file included); every drafted
reply waits for a human `approved: true`. Open findings (the human setup
steps IN-3/4/6/8; IN-15): `docs/inbound/FINDINGS.md`.

## Competitive: the tier that measures us against the field (2026-09-06)

**`docs/competitive/DESIGN.md` is the loop; `FIELD.md` is who is in the
set and why; `VERIFICATION.md` is whether the tier can be trusted;
`docs/cicd/RUNBOOK.md` section 10 is what a human does.** `benchmarks/
competitive/run.py` runs the nulls, jcodemunch and eight adapters over a
pinned corpus set in the D2 container, three runs, the corpus and task
checks refusing before scoring; `/competitive-compare [tool] [ref]` is the
interactive form. ⚠⚠ **Every number comes from a result file**: a FINDINGS
row, a summary and a draft are written by scripts (`findings.py`,
`trend.py`, `compare_ref.py --findings-row`), and a typed number is a
review finding. ⚠⚠ **A competitor's README figure is never a measurement
and competitor code runs only in the sandbox**; a release title is the
only competitor text quoted, as `data`. ⚠ Losses are recorded unsoftened
(CF-20; CF-51: our P2 is 0 on every corpus, a harness mapping defect and
a real loss at once, since a user reaching for the same tool gets the
same answer). The
three scheduled jobs are OFF until a human sets `COMPETITIVE_POST_ENABLED`
and creates the four labels (CF-57); nothing here touches marketing.
Open findings: `docs/competitive/FINDINGS.md`.

## CI/CD: the harness's judgment on every change (2026-09-04)

**`docs/cicd/DESIGN.md` is the pipeline; `docs/cicd/RUNBOOK.md` is what a
human does.** `pr-gate.yml` runs `python -m harness fast|full|check <id>` in
five stages; every job is a REQUIRED check on `main` BY NAME (`fast: *`,
`full: test (<os>, <py>)` x8, `package: install and handshake (<os>)` x2,
`bench: *`, `done: *`, `license/cla`; the list is one `gh api` call, RUNBOOK
§8, and renaming a job is a protection change). `main.yml` re-runs full +
online bench after a merge and OPENS a `regression` issue per failing Floor;
`nightly.yml` does the matrix with fresh corpora (`drift`); `security.yml`
is CodeQL. ⚠⚠ **Read a failed check from its SUMMARY**: one verdict line
`<id> crit <c> floor <cmp v> observed <o> FAIL`, also as an annotation; a
pytest or ruff failure lists the ids. ⚠⚠ **No threshold lives in a
workflow**; `tests/test_workflows_pinned.py` also fails an action not pinned
to a 40-hex SHA or `continue-on-error` outside a job named `(informational)`.
⚠⚠ **Publishing is `release.yml`, dispatched with a version, never local,
never a hand-pushed tag** (the tag path runs the pre-flight and fails it);
trusted publishing on environments `testpypi`/`pypi`, `dry_run` true until
the first real publish is approved (RUNBOOK §1, §5). ⚠ `enforce_admins` and
`strict` are ON; the emergency path is RUNBOOK §6 with a `bypass` issue.
Findings: `docs/cicd/FINDINGS.md`.

## The Standard and the Harness (2026-09-03)

**`docs/standard/STANDARD.md` is the authority on what "good" means here,
and `uv run python -m harness` is the one command that says whether a change meets
it.** Tiers: `fast` (85 offline files + ruff + Floor checks, 90 s ceiling;
run before committing), `full` (all of `tests/` + coverage + skip ceiling,
the PR gate), `bench --offline` (replay, route recall, schema capture,
self-latency; main + Mondays). `check <id>` prints one Floor's verdict. `warm` fetches the tiktoken asset outside the
pytest session; the fast and full tiers do it themselves, and a cold box
that skips it fails 26 token-count tests under the no-network fixture (F-14).
⚠⚠ **A Floor lives ONLY in `harness/thresholds.json`**; a literal restated
anywhere else fails `tests/test_thresholds_are_the_only_copy.py`. Loosening
needs a `loosened` block and is announced on every run. ⚠⚠ **Read
`docs/harness/ARCHAEOLOGY.md` before touching any test** — 491 files, each
with the reason it exists; **retiring one requires a `harness/retired.json`
entry naming the lesson and the replacement assertion**, or
`tests/test_retirement_ledger.py` fails. UNCLEAR items stay byte-identical.
⚠ **Every Floor is a value the tree clears with margin; conservative by
design.** ⚠⚠ **Never copy a figure** from the standard, the archaeology or
here: tool counts, ratios, token weights, latencies and test totals are
recomputed by each block's Method line and stamped with commit and date.
⚠ **Required status checks on `main` are the PR gate's job names** (2026-09-04, RUNBOOK §8 is the one `gh api` call that lists them; the 2026-09-03 list of `lint`/`Retrieval-quality gate`/`test (os, py)` is retired). A renamed job silently stops being required; `uv run python scripts/release_preflight.py` reads the live contexts and fails on a missing run. Open findings: `docs/harness/FINDINGS.md`.

## Key Files

⚠⚠ **This section is the INVARIANTS, not the module map.** The descriptive
half — what each module is — moved to `KEY-FILES.md` on 2026-08-29
(Practice 5's split; the section was 44.4% of a 140,000-char budget). What
stays here is every entry that states a prohibition, a constraint whose
violation causes a defect, or a rationale.
⚠ **A module absent from this section is not absent from the project** — read
`KEY-FILES.md`, or ask jcodemunch, which derives it live.
⚠⚠ **Nothing is duplicated across the two files** and
`tests/test_key_files_split.py` fails if an entry lands in both or neither.
**A new module's entry goes HERE only if it has an invariant to state.**

```
src/jcodemunch_mcp/
  server.py            # MCP dispatcher (async); CLI subcommand dispatch, auth/rate-limit middleware. v1.108.292: `_mcp_instructions()`/`_tool_search_query()`/`_initialization_options()` — the MCP `initialize` `instructions` string, surface-aware (front door on `counter`, the six core tools on `full`), 1,000-char budget. ⚠ Built per `run()`, never passed to `Server(...)` at import: the surface comes from env+config and neither is settled then. ⚠⚠ It is THE ONLY prose that survives tool deferral — a host over its schema budget ships 91 bare names and withholds every description. All three transports pass it; `tests/test_mcp_instructions.py` parses the dispatcher's AST and fails if any `server.run()` goes back to a bare `create_initialization_options()`, which sends an empty field and raises nothing. ⚠ Same line also sets `Server(..., version=__version__)`: omit it and the SDK reports ITS OWN version in `serverInfo` (hosts showed `1.26.0` while we shipped 1.108.x). ⚠⚠ `__version__` is `"unknown"` under `PYTHONPATH=src`, so a green test here does NOT prove the wire carries a real number — **and CI cannot close that gap either, because it runs from source too.** ⚠ **The handshake is verified against the PUBLISHED artifact by `.github/workflows/handshake.yml`** on every published release (2026-09-03, plan item 5; `scripts/handshake.py`, dispatchable with a version). By hand (#536): pin the version and build a fresh venv (`uv venv` + `uv pip install "jcodemunch-mcp==X.Y.Z"`), then run that script. ⚠⚠ **NEVER probe through bare `uvx`** — it served a CACHED build once and showed the SDK's own version with no instructions, i.e. **exactly the pre-fix symptoms from a stale cache rather than a defect.** (2026-08-24, ISSUE-HISTORY.md) v1.108.66: the Counter front door (order/menu/route) — _effective_surface()/_counter_front_door_tools()/_raw_catalog_tools()/_catalog_names() + surface-collapse in _build_tools_list + _handle_order/menu/route + early front-door branch in call_tool
  surface_offer.py     # The priced, opt-in offer to move an EXISTING install onto today's default surface. `build_offer` (None when clean) / `render_offer_lines`. ⚠⚠ **`tool_surface` is written ONCE by `_fresh_config_content` and kept OUT of `generate_template`, so `upgrade_config` can never back-inject it** -- correct, because it stops a package update collapsing a served surface, and also why every seat predating the `counter` default is on `full` PERMANENTLY with no path off it. The freeze made the change unreachable instead of offered. ⚠⚠ **A MESSAGE, NEVER A MIGRATION**: the module does not import `config`, writes nothing, and `upgrade_config` is untouched -- only a command the user types can move the key. `tests/test_surface_offer.py` asserts that over the AST, because **a substring scan fires on the docstring that explains the freeze** (a ratchet failing against something other than the defect it names). ⚠⚠ **Both sides are priced by `_build_tools_list(surface_override=)`, never a local count** -- the counter branch deliberately BYPASSES tier filtering and `disabled_tools`, so a hand-rolled count applies them and UNDER-reports what the client receives; `_schema_tokens_for_profile`'s defect one axis over. ⚠ **Computed per install, never a shipped literal** -- `disabled_tools` or a narrower `tool_profile` gives a different pair. ⚠ Reuses `SCHEMA_TOKENS_BASIS` rather than reformatting the number for persuasion, and discloses the cache-write the switch costs. ⚠ Omit-when-clean (already on target / non-positive delta / silenced); `surface_offer_seen` is a DISPLAY LATCH only and never changes which tools are served. ⚠ NOT wired into `digest` -- a per-repo briefing is the wrong home for a global install-config row.
  install_layout.py    # THE ONE AUTHORITY for "where does this install's code come from?" -- `is_source_layout` / `tree_root_for` / `newest_source_mtime` / `running_source_changed_at`. ⚠⚠ Extracted 2026-08-31 because the question had grown THREE readers with three answers (the drift verdict, the process registry, the surface receipt's assumptions) -- the second-generator/second-call-site mechanism this project keeps paying for. ⚠⚠ **A LEAF, stdlib only**: `cli/init.py` and `storage/process_registry.py` both import it and `storage` importing `cli` is the wrong direction -- the same cycle `cli/policy.py` exists to break. ⚠⚠ **The `src` component is REQUIRED, not decoration**: `<x>/site-packages/jcodemunch_mcp/__init__.py` is ALSO three levels under `<x>`, so a positional check calls a copied install editable whenever a pyproject sits that far up -- shipped in the first draft of the drift fix and caught by its own test. ⚠ **`newest_source_mtime` is the only honest way to ask whether an ALREADY-RUNNING process serves current code** -- a process holds what it imported at startup, and a version string cannot see that because every process on a source install reports the same frozen metadata number. ⚠ Tri-state throughout; `None` is never `False`. `tests/test_process_code_freshness.py` fails if any other module re-derives the src rule, and runs that scan against the reintroduced copy.
  tier_switch_cost.py  # Is a mid-session tool-list change worth what it costs? `breakeven_requests`/`classify` (widening/pays/does_not_pay/noop). ⚠⚠ **`tools` is serialised AHEAD of system and messages**, so a tier switch invalidates the schema block AND every turn behind it, and the new block must be cache-WRITTEN before it reads cheaply again. Measured (`benchmarks/tier_switch/`): `full`->`standard` drops 6.7% of the payload and needs **174 requests** to repay itself with an empty history, **864** with 100k -- `full`->`core` needs 4. ⚠⚠ **The intuition INVERTS on the case that applies**: uncached, the same switch saves 1,810 tokens every request at no one-time cost and pays back immediately. It is wrong only because the block is CACHED (86% of baseline input, `benchmarks/codex_surface/`), which is how a surface built to save tokens shipped a control that spends them. ⚠⚠ **A WIDENING IS NEVER REFUSED** -- escalating after a capability-gated failure buys a capability, and trading a correct answer for a cheap one is the worse error; only a narrowing claims to save. ⚠ `standard` stays a fine STARTUP `tool_profile` (no switch to pay for) and the refusal names that route. ⚠ Rates are PUBLISHED, not measured here; `history_tokens=0` at the call sites because the server cannot see the client's transcript and history only RAISES the price, so the reported figure is a FLOOR. ⚠⚠ Three defects fell out of building it: the first pricer filtered the raw catalog and was wrong by three tools in every tier (hence `_build_tools_list(profile_override=)` -- **price what `list_tools` publishes, never a second copy of the visibility rules**); the refusal's `reason` was put in `_meta`, which `meta_fields: []` (the DEFAULT) strips, so most users would get a bare verdict; and the map ships TWICE, so a ratchet over `DEFAULTS` alone passed while the config TEMPLATE still routed sonnet/gpt-4o at `standard`
  counter.py           # (v1.108.66) The Counter: adaptive tool surface logic (pure, no server import). FRONT_DOOR set; STATE_CHANGING_ACTIONS + exec/write-verb tripwire (_FORBIDDEN_VERB_RE) → order_gate(); idf-weighted search_catalog() for menu; _INTENT_RULES + classify_intent()/shape_execute_args() for route. v1.108.124: EXAMPLES (curated per-action example arg objects) + example_for() — catalog_entry attaches `example` into menu rows, _handle_route uses it as the args_template fallback; validated against live inputSchemas in test_counter.py. server.py owns Tool registration + call_tool re-dispatch; counter.py is fed plain data
  progress.py          # MCP progress notifications; ProgressReporter (thread-safe, monotonic), make_progress_notify() bridge. v1.108.189 adds HeartbeatReporter (#383) — the token-less fallback: elapsed-time WARNING lines on the LOG channel, duck-typing ProgressReporter so the dispatcher wires either identically. ⚠ Holds NO notify channel/session ref by construction (not in __slots__) and close() yields no futures, so it CANNOT become an unrequested notification; silent until the first JCODEMUNCH_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS elapses, and finish() is silent if it never spoke
  security.py          # Path validation, skip patterns, file caps. ⚠ **A build tree is excluded in ELEVEN spellings** — `build`, `.build` and (v1.108.295) `_build`, which is what Elixir/Mix, Sphinx and Dune use — plus (v1.108.303) the eight DOTTED framework trees `.next`/`.nuxt`/`.output`/`.svelte-kit`/`.angular`/`.turbo`/`.parcel-cache`/`.dart_tool`. ⚠⚠ **`.next/server/**` holds a TRANSPILED copy of the pages the user WROTE**, so a Next.js project got its own source twice with the generated copy competing in ranking. ⚠ **DOTTED ONLY** — `out`, `bin`, `obj`, `coverage` and `public` all name real source dirs, and `tests/test_framework_build_trees_are_skipped.py` asserts their ABSENCE as firmly as the eight additions. **`mix` copies dependency SOURCES into `_build`**, so this was the v1.108.234 duplicate-source-tree defect wearing a third name, not a new one. ⚠ Add spellings to `_SKIP_DIRECTORY_NAMES`, never to a derived export — `SKIP_DIRECTORIES` (local walk) and `SKIP_PATTERNS` (GitHub indexer) both derive from it, and editing one reaches only half the product. `verify_package_integrity()` runs on EVERY CLI invocation and its checks are ordered cheapest-first — that ordering IS the fix. ⚠⚠ `packages_distributions()` maps every distribution on `sys.path` to answer a question about ONE: **3.35 s uncached on a box with 894 top-level names, and it returned nothing there** (source tree, no distribution describes it). Targeted `distribution("jcodemunch-mcp")` settles the ordinary install in **5 ms**; the map is reached only when the official dist is absent or did not provide the running module. ⚠⚠ **The map must stay REACHABLE** — it alone can NAME the offending distribution, which is the whole warning; a guard that just banned the call would be satisfied by deleting the security check. ⚠ **Installed-and-correctly-named is NOT sufficient**, so the fast path also proves the official dist owns the running `__file__`. ⚠ Invisible while the CLI was human-typed; the whole cost of a hook once hooks spawn it per call (`hook-pretooluse` 4.0s -> 0.94s). `tests/test_integrity_check_cost.py` asserts the COST as a property, never the call order
  cli/
    policy.py          # (cycles refactor) CLAUDE.md policy text + surface detection + tool filtering; `active_policy()` is the ONE entry point. ⚠⚠ Extracted from `init.py` to break a REAL cycle — `skills.py` needed the policy half, `init.py` needed `install_claude_skill`. This is the LEAF both share and must import NEITHER. ⚠⚠ **`init.py` re-exports every name and that is a MONKEYPATCH TRAP**: patching `init._effective_tool_surface` does NOT affect `policy.active_policy`, which resolves through `policy`'s globals — silently, nothing warns. **Patch `cli.policy`.**
  groq/
  parser/
    complexity.py      # cyclomatic / max_nesting / param_count from body TEXT, no AST. ⚠⚠ **`max_nesting` is `max(bracket_channel, indent_channel)` and BOTH are required.** Brackets alone cannot see Python control flow — `if`/`for`/`while` open a block with a colon and contribute NO bracket depth, so the field reported the deepest EXPRESSION under the same name (`index_folder`: brackets 3, AST truth 6, an underreport by HALF that supported the OPPOSITE conclusion about the symbol). Indentation alone cannot see MINIFIED code, which has none. Max can only RAISE a depth, so brace languages are unmeasured-by-neither and unchanged. ⚠ `max_nesting` is REPORTED (get_symbol_complexity / get_hotspots / get_extraction_candidates / get_pr_risk_profile) and SCORED NOWHERE — `hotspot_score` and `_complexity_assessment` use cyclomatic alone, so correcting it moves no grade. ⚠⚠ A literal BACKSPACE (0x08) once replaced `` in the opener regex and **compiled, ran and passed ruff**; `tests/test_nesting_depth_channels.py` pins the boundary behaviourally and scans for stray control characters
    imports.py         # Regex import extraction (19 languages); extract_imports(), resolve_specifier(), build_psr4_map(). ⚠⚠ **`_JS_SPECIFIER_REWRITES` exists because a TS specifier names the EMITTED file, not the source**: `.mts` is imported as `./foo.mjs` and `.cts` as `./foo.cjs`, extensions that are NEVER on disk. Adding an extension to `LANGUAGE_EXTENSIONS` without its rewrite entry makes the file visible and its importers invisible -- which reads downstream as a file nobody imports, i.e. #550 in a new costume. The `.js -> .ts/.tsx` rule predates the table and is unchanged; `test_ts_module_extensions.py` asserts that byte-for-byte ⚠⚠ **`_tsconfig_skip_dirs()` DERIVES from `security._SKIP_DIRECTORY_NAMES` (#557)** -- it was the FOURTH copy of a skip list in this tree and the only one deriving from nothing, so `_walk_tsconfigs` descended into Rust's `target/` on every watcher event (**13.58s of a 13.75s reindex, 0.27s once excluded**). **Add a spelling to the AUTHORITY, never here.** ⚠ **UNION with `_TSCONFIG_EXTRA_SKIP_DIRS`, never replacement**: `out` is deliberately absent from the authority (the "DOTTED ONLY" rule -- it names a real source dir for the INDEXING walk) but has been skipped for tsconfig discovery for this function's whole life, and **removing a skip is the one direction this may not go**. ⚠ Imported lazily: `security` imports `config`, and resolving that at module scope would put a parser module in the chain for no benefit.

    schemas/             # Per-tool custom encoders (tier-1, phase 2+); auto-discovered registry. ⚠⚠ **A schema that disagrees with its producer about the table KEY is INVISIBLE to the fail-closed guard**: `schema_driven` raises when a table has rows but no declared column populated (#354), and a wrong key yields NO rows, so `out_rows` is empty and the check never runs. (#553: `search_ast` declared `results` where the tool returns `matches`, serving an empty table for every language and preset.) ⚠ `tests/test_search_ast_encoder_contract.py` is the CI ratchet: every declared table key must name something its tool emits. ⚠⚠ **(#555) `sd.encode` also fails closed at RUNTIME on a list-of-dicts under a key no `TableSpec` declares.** It runs POST-transform BY CONSTRUCTION — `search_text._flatten` has already removed the public `results` — so pre-flattening schemas need NO exemption; **scanning the RAW response instead flags `search_text` on every call**, and an allowlist entry for it would be the wrong fix to the right symptom. `allow_undeclared=(...)` is explicit and per-key; raises rather than warns (dispatcher falls back to JSON, data survives). ⚠ **Columns are the second half and the near-miss**: a heterogeneous row set (search_ast carries 16 keys across 10 detectors, 5 of them pattern-specific) loses its payload silently if only the common columns are declared, because `file`/`line` populate and `any_value` goes true. Pattern-specific keys ride as one JSON cell, the `search_text` `before`/`after` shape. A table-key or column change is a WIRE change: bump `ENCODING_ID` and add the old one to `LEGACY_ENCODING_IDS`

Refuses on `corpus_unreadable` and `index_unreadable` (UNKNOWN blocks, same rule as `has_any()`). ⚠ EMPTY-vs-NON-EMPTY deliberately, NOT a shrink threshold: a repo may legitimately lose most of its files, so partial shortfall is DISCLOSED as `indexed_files_not_reparsed`.

Read-only. Pairs with check_rename_safe for the rename-and-delete refactor flows. v1.104.1: track test_import_count separately from external_import_count so test-only consumption correctly downgrades to test_coverage_only. v1.108.6: honest-hint caveat — when `safe_to_delete` is reached AND `include_runtime=True` AND no traces are ingested for the repo (`_runtime_data_present()` returns False), the `recommended_action` surfaces that the verdict rests on static signals only and points at `import-trace`. `signals.runtime_data_present` surfaced for callers to introspect. Back-ported from `check_column_drop_safe` in jdatamunch-mcp v1.8.0. ⚠⚠ **(#566) THE DESTRUCTIVE SURFACE OF THE ABSENCE-CLAIM DEFECT, and it needed its own fix**: the "no refs at all" fallback reaches `safe_to_delete` **regardless of `dead_code_conf`** and then FLOORS the confidence at 0.85, so capping `find_dead_code` alone left a delete certified over a corpus that could not support it -- the twelve `encoding/schemas` encoders of #569 have no refs at all and each graded safe at 0.85. `corpus_inadequate` is the verdict; classified in `_stop_rule._BOUNDED` and never terminal, with `corpus_gap` naming re-indexing. ⚠ **Only the ABSENCE verdicts are replaced** -- a found importer is positive evidence and a thin corpus cannot unfind it, the same asymmetry `_HARD_BLOCKER` encodes. ⚠⚠ `assess_corpus` is imported at MODULE level HERE deliberately: a function-local import resolves through `_corpus_adequacy`'s globals, so patching it in this module would silently do nothing (the `cli/policy.py` trap; found by a test that patched the name and watched the verdict not move).

Numerator-only would shrink a count without shrinking what it is a fraction of: **the 84.0 B -> 88.8 B sign error of 1.108.305.** ⚠ So an entry point with a real `Ce` problem is graded by NOTHING; `coupling_entry_points_excluded` + `coupling_framework_profile` disclose it. ⚠ Only the DETECTED profile excludes -- widening to `_ENTRY_POINT_FILENAMES` moves every Python repo's published score on a heuristic, and needs its own measurement. ⚠⚠ **A REFUSAL IS NOT A ZERO**: `get_dead_code_v2` returning `[]` WITH a `signal_warning` became `dead_code_pct: 0.0` and a dead_code axis of 100 -- the strongest claim assembled from an admission that nothing was established. `dead_code_measurable` feeds `unmeasurable_axes`, which withholds composite and grade.

A young repo is not a truncated one. ⚠ TRI-STATE (`complete: None` = could not establish, never False); `churn_is_measurable()` collapses None to do-not-publish at the grade gate. ⚠ `attach_history_coverage` is SILENT on a covered window by design, and discloses an UNKNOWN
    health_radar.py           # Six-axis health radar (complexity/dead_code/cycles/coupling/test_gap/churn_surface) + diff_health_radar pure-function tool for PR-time diff-grade reporting (v1.87.0). Phase 7 (v1.100.0): optional 7th axis runtime_coverage when caller passes runtime_coverage_pct; axis is omitted otherwise so the composite stays comparable against pre-Phase-7 baselines. diff_radar walks the axes dict generically — picks up the new axis automatically.
    get_untested_symbols.py   # get_untested_symbols: find functions with no test-file reachability (import graph + name matching) ⚠⚠ **`untested_count`/`reached_pct` are measured BEFORE the `max_results` cut (#559)**; the page length is `returned_count`. The count used to be `len(symbols)` POST-slice and `get_repo_health` asks for `max_results=1`, so the published test axis read ~100% reach on every repo with untested code (4,893 of 6,352 published as 100). ⚠ **The response key is `symbols`** -- three consumers invented `untested_symbols`/`untested`/`results` and fell through to `[]` in silence.

    audit_agent_config.py    # audit_agent_config: token waste audit for CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, etc.; cross-refs against index. Reused by suggest_corrections (_discover_files / _fuzzy_suggest / stale-config findings). Skill-candidate advisory (_check_skill_candidates / _split_sections / _best_subtree): flags always-resident H2 sections whose index-resolved refs concentrate in ONE subtree, gated by `skill_advisor_mode` (default off). ⚠ The signal is CONCENTRATION, not size — it returns [] with no index, and `subtreeShareCap` (0.25) not `concentrationFloor` is the discriminator, because a narrow subtree failing the floor hands selection to its permissive parent. ⚠ Findings state relevance was NOT measured; nothing records which section a turn needed
    suggest_corrections.py   # (v1.108.68) Retrieval-regret synthesis: fuses regret.analyze_regret clusters + audit_agent_config + WeightTuner dry-run into SUGGESTED corrections (routing/vocabulary/index-freshness/stale-config/skill-candidate) with difflib unified-diff CLAUDE.md previews. Read-only charter — never writes a user file; apply_weights touches only tuning.jsonc. Honest no-telemetry hint. ⚠ v1.108.290 passes `inflation` through EVEN WHEN UNMEASURABLE — a caller who cannot see WHY the ratio is absent reads its absence as zero inflation (#500: a number computed and discarded is the same defect as not computing it). ⚠ `_stale_config_corrections` read `f["type"]` while audit findings carry `category`, so stale_config had NEVER emitted; both spellings accepted now. ⚠ skill_candidate keeps `suggested_patch: None` deliberately — a diff showing only the deletion reads as "delete this section"

Same UNKNOWN-is-not-False rule as `ledger_trust`. ⚠ Invalidation is PROCESS-LOCAL (5 sites, index-mutating tools only), so the PostToolUse `index-file` spawn, the watcher, `refresh` and a second server instance all move the index without the cache hearing it. ⚠⚠ **`_diff_baseline` differenced latency against a baseline that never measured it** — `float(b.get("p50_ms", 0.0))`, while the only SHIPPED baseline carries `tokens_saved` and no latency keys, so the current p95 was published as `p95_delta_ms`. Absent -> `None` + `not_comparable` naming the side; **calls/tokens keep a meaningful zero on the CURRENT side, latency has none**. ⚠ Its test fixture carried keys the real artifact lacks, so the path was invisible; the guard reads every baseline OFF DISK. ⚠⚠ **`slowest_by_p95` answers how slow ONE call is and was the only ranking** — `heaviest_by_total_ms`/`totals` answer where the time WENT (count x latency; the orderings disagree whenever a fast tool is called often). A share over a zero total REFUSES; a **ring-capped tool's share is a LOWER BOUND** and is named, because the 512-call cap bites hardest on the busiest tool. ⚠ The per-tool shape has ONE producer, `token_tracker.latency_bucket` (this module's `_percentile` is deleted, not wrapped); `p95_is_max` is MEASURED, and fires for every n <= 20

## CLI Subcommands

⚠⚠ **This section is the INVARIANTS, not the command list.** The full table
— what each subcommand does — moved to `CLI-AND-ENV.md` on 2026-08-31
(Practice 5's split). What stays is every row that states a prohibition, a
constraint whose violation causes a defect, or a rationale.
⚠ **A subcommand absent from this section is not absent from the CLI** — read
`CLI-AND-ENV.md`, or run `jcodemunch-mcp --help`, which derives it live.
⚠⚠ Nothing is duplicated across the two files and
`tests/test_cli_env_split.py` fails if a row lands in both or neither.
**A new subcommand's row goes HERE only if it has an invariant to state.**

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `uninstall [target]` | (v1.105.1) Reverse `init` / `install`. Preserves user-authored hook rules and content outside our policy region; removes files only when empty after stripping. `--keep-claude-md`, `--keep-hooks`, etc. scope what's reversed |
| `refresh [path]` | (v1.108.259, #395) Re-parse an INDEXED repo in bounded, resumable slices — `--max-seconds` / `--max-files` / `--pause-ms` / `--batch-size` / `--status` / `--reset` / `--ai-summaries` / `--json`. For fleets where a full re-index is a scheduled maintenance event. ⚠ Does NOT build a first index; refuses with the command that does. ⚠ Stamps `parser_generation` only after VERIFIED full-corpus coverage |
| `import-trace [--otel <path> \| --sql-log <path> \| --stack-log <path>] [--repo <id>] [--no-redact]` | (Phases 1 + 4 + 5) Ingest a runtime trace file into the runtime_* tables. `--otel` takes JSON / JSON-Lines / .gz and maps spans by `(code.filepath, code.lineno, code.function)`; `--sql-log` takes pg_stat_statements CSV or generic SQL JSON-Lines and maps queries by referenced tables + dbt/SQLMesh column metadata; `--stack-log` takes plain-text app log or JSON-Lines record set with Python / JVM / Node.js tracebacks and writes severity-tagged frame counts to runtime_stack_events. Redacts PII at the chokepoint by default. Pass exactly one source flag. |
| `hook-precompact` | PreCompact hook: register transcript root before compaction (reads JSON stdin; snapshot delivery is `hook-sessionstart`) |
| `hook-sessionstart` | (v1.108.255, #420) SessionStart hook: re-inject the PreCompact snapshot into MODEL context on `compact`/`resume`/`fork`. Silent on `startup`/`clear`, because an unrelated session's journal presents stale files as current focus. Also the earliest point a custom-profile transcript root can be learned (#421), so registration runs BEFORE the source gate |
| `receipt` | Token-economy ledger from Claude transcripts — modeled tokens-saved + dollar value at Fable/Opus/Sonnet/Haiku rates; `--explain`, `--export csv\|json`, `--days` (rolling), `--model`. v1.108.134: `--since`/`--until` for calendar windows (local dates; `--until` exclusive) + `--by-day` for a per-day series in the JSON export. v1.108.135: `--rates` dumps the model price table as JSON (scans nothing) so consumers price from the one table instead of a drifting copy |
| `reflect` | (v1.108.68) Surface retrieval regret as SUGGESTED config corrections — `reflect [repo] [--project-path] [--window-days N] [--all] [--apply-weights] [--json]`. Thin CLI over the `suggest_corrections` tool; read-only (only `--apply-weights` writes, and only the tuning.jsonc sidecar) |

## Architecture Notes
- `index_folder` is **synchronous** — dispatched via `asyncio.to_thread()` in server.py to avoid blocking the event loop
- `index_repo` is **async** (uses httpx for GitHub API)
- `has_index()` distinguishes "no file on disk" from "file exists but version rejected"
- Symbol lookup is O(1) via `__post_init__` id dict in `CodeIndex`

## Custom Parsers
Tree-sitter grammar lacks clean named fields for these — custom regex extractors:
- **Erlang**: multi-clause function merging by (name, arity); arity-qualified names (e.g. `add/2`)
- **Fortran**: module-as-container, qualified names (`math_utils::multiply`), parameter constants
- **SQL**: `_parse_sql_symbols` + `sql_preprocessor.py` strips Jinja (dbt); macro/test/snapshot/materialization as symbols
- **Razor/Blazor** (.cshtml/.razor): `@functions/@code` → C#, `@page`/`@inject` → constants, HTML ids

## Env Vars

⚠⚠ **This section is the INVARIANTS, not the variable list.** The full table
moved to `CLI-AND-ENV.md` on 2026-08-31 (Practice 5's split); every default is
in `src/jcodemunch_mcp/config.py` and `jcodemunch-mcp config` prints the
effective value with its source. What stays is every row that states a
prohibition, a constraint whose violation causes a defect, or a rationale.
⚠⚠ Nothing is duplicated across the two files and
`tests/test_cli_env_split.py` fails if a row lands in both or neither.
**A new variable's row goes HERE only if it has an invariant to state.**

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `JCODEMUNCH_TRUSTED_FOLDERS` | — | Roots trusted for index_folder; whitelist mode by default |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PERF_TELEMETRY` | 0 | Set 1 to enable persistent perf SQLite sink at ~/.code-index/telemetry.db (per-tool latency + ok flag + repo). In-memory ring is always tracked; the env var only controls durable persistence. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RUNTIME_REDACT` | 1 | (Phase 0) Set 0 to disable PII redaction at the runtime trace ingest chokepoint. Off ONLY for offline debugging on synthetic data — never on production traces. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RUNTIME_INGEST_ENABLED` | 0 | (Phase 6) Set 1 to enable the HTTP live-ingest endpoints (POST /runtime/otel, /runtime/sql, /runtime/stack). Requires JCODEMUNCH_HTTP_TOKEN. Off by default — write endpoints are a deliberate two-key turn. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RUNTIME_INGEST_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | 5242880 | (Phase 6) Per-request body cap in bytes (post-decompression). Decompressed size is checked separately from on-wire size — gzip-bomb guard. Minimum 1024. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_OPENAI_EXTRA_BODY` | — | JSON object merged into every OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` + `/responses` summarizer request (config key `openai_extra_body`, project-overridable). Disable a thinking model's reasoning so the output budget isn't burned on reasoning tokens, e.g. `{"chat_template_kwargs":{"enable_thinking":false}}` (#323) |
| `JCODEMUNCH_WATCH_POLL_DELAY_MS` | 1000 | (v1.108.83) Poll interval (ms) used ONLY when watchfiles falls back to polling — which it auto-enables under WSL (#356). Default raised from watchfiles' 300ms to cut idle CPU; ignored when native FS events are in use. Falls back to `WATCHFILES_POLL_DELAY_MS` if set; non-positive/garbage → default. For Linux-filesystem repos under WSL, `WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=false` opts back into inotify (~0 idle CPU). |
| `JCODEMUNCH_LIVE_JOURNAL` | 1 | (v1.108.57) Set `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to disable the live session-journal write (`<CODE_INDEX_PATH>/_session_live.json`). On by default so the out-of-process PreCompact hook can read real session state (#334); throttled ≤1/~2s, paths+queries only, no file contents. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_TOOL_SURFACE` | `full` | (v1.108.66) Tool surface selector (config key `tool_surface`; env wins). `counter` collapses `list_tools` to the 3-tool front door (`order`/`menu`/`route`) + always-present controls. Any other value (default `full`) preserves existing tiered behavior byte-for-byte — front-door tools stay hidden but callable. Composes with the `core`/`standard`/`full` tier profiles. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_LICENSE_KEY` | — | (v1.108.42) jCodeMunch license key (config key `license_key`). Gates the `org-rollup` team feature ONLY; everything else is free. Validated online vs `validate.php` (sticky-offline cache; 14-day grace for new orgs). **Requires a multi-seat tier — Studio or Platform** (v1.108.43); Builder doesn't unlock org-rollup. Check with the `license` CLI. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_INDEX_CACHE_TTL` | 0 (off) | (v1.108.172) Seconds an unused hydrated index may sit in the in-memory cache before being released. **OPT-IN: 0/unset/garbage = disabled = today's behavior exactly.** ⚠ **Do NOT default this on** — cold hydration of a 665k-symbol index was measured at 7.5-11.4 min (#370), so evicting during a quiet spell hands the next query that bill. For hosts whose MCP client leaks stdio servers (#375: 25+ instances, ~17 GB), where each idle process otherwise sits on its own cache. Swept on access, no timer thread. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PROVIDER_BUDGET_SECONDS` | 30.0 | (v1.108.182) Wall-clock ceiling on ONE context provider's `detect()`+`load()`. Discovery runs before a single file is indexed, so an unbounded provider takes the whole index down with it (#375). On overrun the provider is skipped and NAMED in `providers_skipped` + `warnings`. `0`/negative = no ceiling (pre-.182 inline behaviour). ⚠ **A watchdog stops the CALLER waiting; it cannot stop the work** — Python cannot preempt a thread, so the abandoned provider keeps burning CPU until it finishes or polls `budget_expired()`. Only the Express walk polls it so far. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_PARSE_BUDGET_SECONDS` | 20.0 | (v1.108.182) Per-file wall-clock ceiling on `parse_file`, via `parse_file_budgeted`. On overrun the file is skipped and named in the index result's `warnings` instead of the run hanging. ⚠ **Armed only at or above 128 KiB** (`_PARSE_WATCHDOG_MIN_BYTES`) so the common path stays inline — a 2 KB file that takes 20s is a bug to see, not to paper over. `0`/negative disables. Same no-preemption caveat: tree-sitter is C code. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_MAX_FILE_SIZE` | 512000 | (v1.108.193, @dkiaulakis) Per-file byte cap for indexing (config key `max_file_size`; **settable per-project in `.jcodemunch.jsonc` as of v1.108.197 — before that the project file was parsed and then ignored**). ⚠ **This was the ONE limit of three with no route at all** — its neighbours `max_index_files`/`max_folder_files` each had a resolver, this was hardcoded. **Default deliberately UNCHANGED**; this is an escape hatch. ⚠ A file over the cap is `too_large`, which is now **WITHHELD** (real+current+wanted) rather than an ordinary exclusion, so it makes coverage `complete: false` and **refuses absence claims**. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RESPECT_CACHEDIR_TAG` | 1 | (v1.108.270) Honour the Cache Directory Tagging Specification (<https://bford.info/cachedir/>): prune any directory holding a `CACHEDIR.TAG` whose **first 43 bytes** are the spec signature (config key `respect_cachedir_tag`). ⚠⚠ **The signature is VERIFIED — a file merely NAMED `CACHEDIR.TAG` excludes nothing.** A name-only check is an assertion about one instance of the property instead of the property, which is the exact defect class this answers. ⚠ The only exclusion rule here **declared by the WRITER** rather than listed by us, so a tool that drops a cache in your tree is honoured without jcm knowing its name, and it covers caches that are **not dotted** (which a dot-dir rule cannot). Counted as `cache_dir` in `discovery_skip_counts`; **NOT a withheld reason**, so absence stays citable — a tagged dir is derived data by its writer's own declaration, i.e. corpus definition like `gitignore`. Only an explicit `false` disables it. ⚠ Local walks only; `index_repo` is deliberately uncovered because validating the signature needs blob CONTENT the tree listing does not carry. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_RESPONSE_MAX_BYTES` | 1048576 | (v1.108.257, #425) Ceiling on a SINGLE MCP tool response in bytes, enforced in a wrapper AROUND the `call_tool` dispatcher (config key `response_max_bytes`). ⚠⚠ **This is a RESPONSE limit, deliberately NOT `max_file_size`** - before it existed, an INDEXING cap in another subsystem bounded reply size by coincidence, so raising that key to cover a large generated file silently raised the maximum reply. ⚠ Over the cap the call REFUSES with a structured error naming size, limit and the key that moves it; it never truncates, because a shortened body is indistinguishable from a complete one. `0` disables; any other invalid value falls back to the default so a typo cannot uncap the server. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` | 30.0 | (v1.108.189, #383) Elapsed wall-clock seconds between heartbeat log lines when the client sent **no `progressToken`** — the MCP spec makes progress notifications the client's opt-in, so the fallback signal goes to the log instead. Emitted at **WARNING** (the default `log_level`, or nobody sees it) and **only after the first interval elapses**, so a run finishing inside the window is byte-for-byte as silent as before. ⚠ **Garbage parses to the DEFAULT, not to 0** — a typo must not reintroduce the silence this exists to fix. `0`/negative disables. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_EMBED_MATRIX_CACHE` | 1 | (v1.108.223, #399) Set `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` to stop RETAINING the decoded embedding matrix between queries. ⚠ **It does not disable the fast path** — the matrix is still built per call and scored in one vectorised pass, so only the SQLite decode is re-paid. On by default because the cache is what turns a ~2 s semantic query into ~3 ms; bounded to 2 repositories (~46 MB each at 30k x 384 float32) and dropped on every write to the store. Process memory only: nothing written, no network, dies with the process. Disclosed in README's "Background behavior". |
| `JCODEMUNCH_SCIP_MAX_ROWS` | 200000 | (v1.108.96) Row cap for `scip_edges` / `scip_unmapped` (compile-time evidence from `import-scip`); FIFO-evicted oldest-first in 1k batches. Negative disables the cap; env-only, deliberately not a config key. |
| `JCODEMUNCH_LAUNCH_ID` | — | (v1.108.152) Opaque host-supplied launch token echoed back as `launch_id` in the `munch://runtime/identity` resource (#371). Fallback: suite-generic `MUNCH_LAUNCH_ID`. Omitted from the payload when unset. Env-only, not a config key. |

### Tool-description quality (`benchmarks/description_smells/`)

Descriptions are scored against the rubric in arXiv:2602.14878. Two rules when you
touch a tool description:

- **`core_compact` has a HARD ceiling of 4,000 tokens** (v2 §10). The drift ratchet
  in `tests/test_schema_budget.py` offers "or update the baseline"; the sibling
  ceiling tests forbid it. Trim the description instead. Measured 2026-09-02 at **3,998 of 4,000** (#571) --
  TWO tokens, so the next core-tier description edit breaches it. ⚠ The live
  gate recomputes from `_build_tools_list()`; the frozen-baseline sibling only
  fails AFTER a regeneration, i.e. after the breach shipped.
- **`tests/test_description_smells.py` gates Purpose and Length.** A new tool with a
  one-line description fails it. Two substantive sentences minimum: what it does and
  returns, plus one boundary or usage cue.

⚠ The audit reports two frames. The paper's scanner never sees `inputSchema`, so
schema-documented parameters score 1/5 by its rubric. Quote both frames or neither.

### Rust fidelity (`benchmarks/rust_fidelity/`)

Rust extraction vs **Rust's own parser** (`syn`). Four buckets gate at **0**:
`extra`, `wrong_span`, `undercount`, `qual_mismatch`; `missing` is reported by
kind. ripgrep @ `3fce3b5b`, 110 files: **95.8%**, 3,517 symbols, `missing` (156)
entirely `module`+`macro`, both deliberate.

⚠⚠ **CEILING LOWER THAN RACKET'S: `syn` PARSES, it does not EXPAND.** A
`macro_rules!`-generated item is invisible to the oracle AND to us, unscored in
BOTH directions — a green run is NOT evidence about macro-generated code.

⚠⚠ **THE FIRST THREE BUCKETS KEYED BARE NAMES IN A SET, AND A SET CANNOT
COUNT.** Proven by deleting the second symbol of every duplicated name in the
fixtures: `extra` and `missing` did not move, so a run extracting ONE of
`defs.rs`'s 108 `is_switch` graded like a complete one. It was hiding a **37.9%
in-file name-collision rate** (1,331/3,514, 44 of 110 files). `undercount`
counts qualified names; `qual_mismatch` compares owners. **The owner is
`self_ty`, never the trait.**

⚠⚠ **FOUR oracle traps, every one makes US look wrong when the HARNESS is.**
(1) Read the **identifier's** span, not the item's — `Item::span()` starts at the
first doc comment, scoring us **40.4%** vs a true **95.4%**; the tell was we were
NEVER earlier. (2) Walk **function bodies** — `#[cfg]`-paired inner `fn`, 8× in
one ripgrep file; stopping at item level **inverts the `extra` gate**. (3) Walk
**nested** blocks (`for` body, `match` arm) — hence `syn::visit::Visit`, because
**a hand-rolled walk only sees where its author remembered to look.** (4) A self
type with no path (`&[u8]`, `(u8, u8)`) must be rendered from its TOKENS;
returning nothing there files those members under a bare name and puts the
oracle BELOW the extractor it scores.

⚠ `build_oracle()` once reused a STALE binary after a failed rebuild, reporting
the numbers UNCHANGED — which reads as "the change had no effect" rather than
"the change did not compile". It always rebuilds now.

⚠⚠ **`test_rust_fidelity.py` listed its fixture names as a LITERAL in every
`parametrize`** — a second roster beside the frozen artifact, and only the
artifact had a test keeping it honest, so a new fixture was ungated on arrival.
Read off disk now. CI runs it off FROZEN oracle data (no toolchain, no network);
regenerate per `tests/fixtures/rust/REGENERATE.md`.

### Codex tool-surface benchmark (`benchmarks/codex_surface/`) — NEGATIVE result

⚠ Shipped in 1.108.271. A STANDING warning about a measurement, not a release
note that ages out. Forensics in `ISSUE-HISTORY.md` (2026-07).

⚠⚠ **Do not quote the arm numbers; the honesty gate fired.** The largest arm
difference was smaller than the baseline's variation against ITSELF, and the
directions were incoherent. The hypothesis is **untested, not disproven** — the
instrument cannot resolve an effect that size.

⚠⚠ **The finding that outlived the arms, and it corrects a claim this project
made: 86% of baseline input is CACHED.** The schema block is stable across
requests, so it is paid at full rate roughly ONCE and at cache-read rates after.
Any framing of "24,007 tokens in every request" is wrong, and that framing was
used here before measuring. **The fixed-cost story is a WEAKER explanation for
the r/codex result than the raw number suggests, not a stronger one.**

⚠⚠ **`tool_profile: "standard"` is NOT a token lever: it drops 9 of 91 tools and
5.7% of the payload.** `core` (74.0%) and `counter` (95.9%) are the only two
settings that move the number; there is no gradient between them, and the config
surface implies there is. ⚠ Under `full`, tool DESCRIPTIONS are 36% of the
payload and `compact_schemas` rewrites input schemas only — schema compaction is
near its floor, descriptions are untouched ground.

### Tier-switch pricing (`benchmarks/tier_switch/`)

⚠⚠ **A mid-session tier switch is priced, and one of the three tiers is a
LOSING destination.** `full` -> `standard` needs **174 requests** to repay the
cache it invalidates (**864** with 100k of history); `full` -> `core` needs
**4**. Regenerate with `price_tier_switch.py`; weights are read live from
`_build_tools_list`, so nothing here is hand-typed. `tier_switch_cost.classify`
refuses the non-paying narrowing at both switch sites and never refuses a
widening.

⚠ **This EXTENDS the codex_surface finding below, it does not repeat it.** That
one says `standard` is not a lever (6.7% of the payload). The addition is that
as a TRANSITION it is negative, for longer than any session lasts -- and that
the "fewer tokens is better" intuition is correct uncached and wrong cached,
which is the whole reason it shipped.

⚠⚠ **The published `counter` surface is BYTE-PINNED** (v1.108.314,
`tests/test_counter_surface_stability.py`): six tools, **4,184 B**, by name AND
order, per-tool sha, total bytes, whitelist membership, and independence from
`tool_profile`. **A reworded description is a full-rate cache write for every
user** — a failure there is the prefix moving, not a broken test, so update the
baseline only once that cost is accepted and say so in the CHANGELOG. ⚠ It pins
the property arXiv:2608.22708 (CacheRouter) is built around — the catalog can
GROW without moving the prefix — which the Counter already had by construction
and nothing asserted. That paper routes long-tail tools to a SUB-MODEL that
selects and executes (lossy; ours is not) and prices against a NO-CACHE baseline
at DeepSeek's ~1/30 cache-hit ratio vs Anthropic's 0.1x, so its headline does
not transfer to a surface already 86% cached.

⚠⚠ **Quote `benchmarks/schema_baseline.json`, never a figure from the harness.**
It is written by `benchmarks/harness/capture_schema_baseline.py` and guarded by
`tests/test_schema_budget.py`; the harness counts a different payload shape, so
the two will never agree digit for digit and neither is wrong. The Counter
avoids **95.9%**, not the ~98% `run_route_recall.py` asserted for two months —
that literal is computed from the baseline at runtime now, with a test that
fails if any schema-saving percentage returns to that file. **The gap existed
because the budget guardrail only walked `tool_profile`, which does not apply to
the front door at all**, so the largest lever in the project had no test under it.


**Dated entries are rotated out.** Closed issue and PR history lives in
`ISSUE-HISTORY.md`, verbatim, and is NOT loaded into a session. Grep it by
date or issue number. ⚠⚠ **Never quote an open-issue count, an open-PR count or a
timebox date from either file — run the query.** Those are the only facts here
with a guaranteed expiry date, and this section carried a self-contradictory one
for three weeks before the rotation caught it.

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh issue list --state open ; GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh pr list --state open
```

### Standing lessons

Each names a date to grep for in `ISSUE-HISTORY.md`.

- **We fix the reported call site and leave the mechanism.** Three times in three
  days (08-19, #506/#507/#508/#509): a second generator, a second call site, a
  second derivation. The one-sentence fix each time is *ask the authority instead
  of reproducing its logic*. ⚠⚠ **09-02 (#572) is the same shape in a cache, and
  the contributor made the argument for us:** `search_symbols` had fixed
  return-the-stored-object twice inside its OWN cache (#377 item 3, then #404)
  and neither fix reached the SHARED one, so a display preference kept editing
  cached data. **Ask whether the fix belongs one layer down, where the tool
  written next inherits it.**
- **Write the ratchet before concluding the reported list is the list.** 08-18
  #489 reported three sites; a test over the PROPERTY found five. Same at #447
  (three spellings of one path rule) and #491.
- **A test for a destructive defect EXECUTES it on the non-vacuity pass.** 08-20
  #447 wrote a real file into a real Windows system directory because the target
  came from the report verbatim. The target must be somewhere the test owns.
- **A concurrency test must pin the interleaving.** 08-17 #490: signal-and-race
  passed against the broken source. The non-vacuity count is the tell (7/8, then
  8/8). [[a-concurrency-test-must-pin-the-interleaving]]
- **A mock broad enough to satisfy an assertion can bypass what the assertion is
  about.** 08-13 #439/#453, three costumes in one day, including a guard that
  could not fire because it raised `AssertionError` into a bare `except`.
- **A parameter that is present and does nothing is indistinguishable from the
  defect it was added to fix.** 08-19 #508: `repo=` threaded through six sites
  with nothing on the path loading what it reads.
- **Fixing a producer does not fix its history.** 08-05 #414: re-indexing is a
  no-op when the corrupt rows sit in files that never changed. Hence
  `PARSER_GENERATION`, checked BEFORE every early-returning fast path.
  [[feedback_fixing_a_producer_does_not_fix_its_history]]
- **Verify at the user's entry point.** 08-04 #412: the defect was real one layer
  down and the served response was merely contradictory.
  [[feedback_verify_at_the_users_entry_point]]
- **A principle stated over a set can be right for part of it.** 08-18 #488:
  "explicit beats default" was safe for the free on-machine provider and would
  have started billing a remote account for the paid ones. A red test was the
  spec. [[a-principle-over-a-set-may-be-right-for-part-of-it]]
- **A version line is a CONVENTION, and conventions do not fail builds.** 08-20
  #521: LICENSE condition 2 gained an obligation while the header stayed at 1.1.
  Pin the terms by digest so the substantive-or-editorial call happens AT the edit.
- **Measure the safe fix before choosing the risky one.** 08-13 #442: the obvious
  low-risk shape captured 2% of the available saving.
- **A setting fixed in one repo of a suite is fixed in one repo.** 08-20: jdoc and
  jdata had matrices that had never run, under a check nobody reported.
- **A defect is not evidence against the number it did not produce.** 08-22: a
  per-call over-count in six analytical tools was written up as putting a basis
  change behind the PUBLISHED savings figure. The number quoted was one seat's
  statusline, the site's is a separate opt-in aggregate, and the tools feeding it
  already deduped by file. **Trace the path to the specific figure before
  implicating it, and never net coverage-conservatism against a per-call basis
  error — they are different axes.** [[a-defect-is-not-evidence-against-the-number-it-did-not-produce]]
- **A ratchet can pass against the defect it names.** 08-22: the savings-baseline
  guard used a depth-limited regex and walked straight past
  `sum(int(s.get("byte_length", 0) or 0) for ...)`, two parens deep. It only
  showed up on the non-vacuity pass. **Run a text-scanning ratchet against the
  reintroduced defect, never only against the fixed tree** — a green ratchet and
  an absent ratchet look identical.
- **A guard sampled AFTER the work can be tripped by the work.** 08-24: the
  reuse audit read the .db-rewritten probe at the end of its scan, and its own
  semantic channel opens a read-WRITE connection that moves that mtime -- so it
  reported a concurrent rebuild it had caused itself and made its best verdict
  unreachable. **Ask what the check's own footprint does to the thing it
  measures, then sample before it.** Excluding a known false positive repairs a
  proxy; it does not weaken the guard.
- **A module that imports clean has been tested for nothing.** 08-24: 884 lines
  written in one pass, imports clean, four defects on first execution -- three
  of them a check that could not observe what it claimed to check, including a
  `match_strength` published on every row that was always 0.0 because
  `search_symbols` emits `score` only under `debug=True`. **Run it before
  reviewing it; the read-through found none of these.**
- **A set cannot count, and a comparison built on one cannot fail.** 08-27: the
  Rust fidelity harness graded a 37.9% name-collision rate as a perfect run,
  because both sides keyed bare names into sets and every repeat of a name
  collapsed to one entry. **The tell is that the check would report the same
  answer if half the matches vanished** — test that directly by deleting them.
  Same shape as #553's fixture and #554's positive-only assertions: a green
  signal about something the instrument cannot observe.
  [[a-guard-covered-only-by-positive-tests-can-be-deleted]]
- **Ask what a measurement's DENOMINATOR does when the thing you are testing
  changes.** 08-27: cache-hit RATE cannot separate tool-surface arms, because a
  stable prefix raises numerator and denominator together, so the arm carrying
  the least schema scores the highest. The cut was not merely inconclusive, it
  was incapable — and it will be suggested again by the next cache paper.
- **Dropping an unmeasurable axis is not the same as omitting an inapplicable
  one, and the difference has a SIGN.** 08-28: gating `churn_surface` on a
  shallow clone by omitting it — the convention `runtime_coverage` already uses
  — took the same tree from **84.0 B to 88.8 B** while full-clone truth was
  **77.3 C**. **Removing a low-scoring axis RAISES a mean**, so the fix moved
  the published grade further from reality than the defect had. NOT APPLICABLE
  may be dropped silently; COULD NOT MEASURE must withhold the composite and
  the grade. ⚠ Ask which direction a "safe" omission moves the number before
  shipping it. [[a-one-directional-check-certifies-its-blind-side]]
- **`.get(key, default)` is not a None guard when the key EXISTS.** 08-28:
  `diff_radar`'s `.get("composite", 0.0)` raised the moment a composite was
  legitimately `None` — the default never fires for a present key. ⚠ And the
  0.0 it would have supplied was worse than the crash: a ~77-point regression
  reported against a side nobody measured. Same shape as
  [[a-module-that-imports-clean-has-been-tested-for-nothing]].
- **The host's timezone can select a test's INPUT FORMAT.** 08-28: git renders
  a UTC offset as `Z`, which `datetime.fromisoformat` could not parse before
  3.11 — so a boundary date was unreadable on 3.10, in CI only. Every runner is
  UTC; this box is CDT and got `-05:00`, which parses everywhere. ⚠⚠ **No local
  run on any version could reproduce it, `uv run --python 3.13` included** —
  the version matrix was not the axis that mattered. Pin format-sensitive
  parsing with a UNIT test over every spelling; an integration test can only
  observe the one its host emits. [[a-module-that-imports-clean-has-been-tested-for-nothing]]
- **A command that does not CREATE its environment is testing whatever was
  left there.** 08-28: the release checklist's CI-env reproduce ran
  `uv run --python 3.13 python -m pytest` with no sync and no `--extra watch`,
  so it inherited `.venv`. It looked right for months because a previous sync's
  packages survived; switching interpreters cleared them and **105 tests
  silently stopped executing while the run reported exit 0 and the totals
  reconciled exactly**. ⚠ Read the SKIP count, not just the exit code and the
  total. ⚠⚠ The fix is in a GITIGNORED skill file, so the durable copy and its
  ratchet live in the repo — `tests/test_ci_env_reproduce_command.py` binds
  CLAUDE.md's command to `pr-gate.yml`'s install line (it was `test.yml` until 2026-09-04).
  [[pipes-and-missing-xdist-both-report-exit-zero]]
- **A denylist catches the instance; an allowlist catches the class.** 08-28:
  `relnotes.md`, a scratch copy of the release notes, was swept up by
  `git add -A` and shipped inside the published sdist. The sdist canary tests
  prove NAMED bad paths are absent and could never have seen it — a scratch
  file has no name to plant a canary under. ⚠ **Build release notes outside the
  repository**; a `.gitignore` entry protects only the spelling someone
  remembered. ⚠ Assert the allowlist in BOTH directions — an entry naming a
  file that no longer ships makes the list stop describing the artifact.
  ⚠⚠ **It found a SECOND instance minutes later and it was mine**: `suite.log`,
  the pytest redirect used for every gate run that day, sitting in the repo
  root. A release cut while one existed ships it, and a pytest log carries
  absolute paths and usernames. **Redirect gate runs to the scratchpad, never
  the repo.**
- **A field written by nobody's reader is a defect with no symptom.** 08-28
  (#561/#562): `detect_framework` persisted `entry_point_patterns` into
  `context_metadata` at index time, and a tree-wide search found that key
  written in ONE place and read in NONE. Three tools each reproduced their own
  "is this a root?" answer and every one was Python, so a Next.js repo detected
  zero entry points. ⚠⚠ **An unconsumed field also rots unnoticed**: Flask and
  FastAPI carried `"*.py"` there, which under fnmatch declares the whole tree —
  the first naive reader would have switched dead-code detection off across an
  ecosystem. **Grep a persisted field for its readers before trusting it, and
  before adding one.** [[a-module-that-imports-clean-has-been-tested-for-nothing]]
- **A count taken after the page is cut describes the page.** 08-28 (#559):
  `untested_count = len(symbols)` ran after the `max_results` slice, so
  `get_repo_health`'s `max_results=1` published ~100% test reach on every repo
  with untested code. ⚠ **Invisible to any single-call test** — one call's
  number is self-consistent; only two page sizes over the SAME repo can see it.
  ⚠ And the paired half: **a refusal is not a zero.** `get_dead_code_v2`
  returning `[]` WITH a `signal_warning` became `dead_code_pct: 0.0` and an axis
  of 100. [[a-one-directional-check-certifies-its-blind-side]]
- **An optimisation has a SWITCHING cost, and the intuition about it inverts
  once the thing is cached.** 08-30: `set_tool_tier("standard")` narrowed the
  tool block by 6.7% and cost a full-rate rewrite of the whole cached prefix --
  **174 requests to break even, 864 with 100k of history**, against 4 for
  `core`. ⚠⚠ **Uncached the same switch pays back immediately**, which is why a
  surface built to save tokens shipped a control that spends them: "fewer
  tokens is better" is true right up to the point the block is stable. **Ask
  what a saving costs to START, not only what it saves per unit.** ⚠ A
  *widening* is never refused — it buys a capability, and only a narrowing
  claims to save. [[a-one-directional-check-certifies-its-blind-side]]
- **A reason placed in `_meta` is deleted on a default install.** 08-30:
  `meta_fields` defaults to `[]` and the dispatcher strips `_meta`, so a
  refusal's explanation would have reached most users as a bare verdict, with
  the cause removed by a display preference nobody would connect to it.
  **A refusal's reason is part of the answer; `_meta` is for what a user may
  switch off.** ⚠ Found by the test, not by review — the local box had a
  non-default config, which is the #437 shape exactly.
  [[a-module-that-imports-clean-has-been-tested-for-nothing]]
- **A constant written for a FUTURE date is wrong for the whole interval before
  it, and looks identical to a stale one.** 09-01: the receipt priced `sonnet`
  at $3 from 2026-06-24, the increase SCHEDULED for 2026-09-01 — cancelled the
  day before. Sonnet 5 was never $3; the entry was wrong all 69 days, and its
  dated comment made it look checked. ⚠⚠ **The pin agreed with it** (two literal
  `3.0`s plus a DERIVED `"$0.09"` a name-search cannot see), so green meant
  nothing — **re-read the SOURCE when touching a pinned table, never the other
  copy.** ⚠ Four copies suite-wide; ours was right only in
  `token_tracker.py`, whose key is `claude_sonnet_4_6`: **a key naming a FAMILY
  inherits whichever member's price someone last looked at.**
- **A guard written against a SPELLING is fixed for that spelling only.** 09-01
  (#566): #550 taught that `from . import receipts` depends on `receipts.py`,
  then gated the fix on `set(specifier) == {"."}`. `from ..retrieval import
  embed_drift` is the same dependency with the package named, and it kept
  resolving to `__init__.py` for the whole life of the "fix" — 21 edges over 12
  modules on our own `src/`, every one of them published by `find_dead_code` at
  **confidence 1.0**. ⚠ The reported case and the property are different sizes;
  #550's own comment argued the property and the code implemented the example.
  ⚠⚠ **And the same error twice more in the fix**: the code comment's first
  count (134) and the first repo-level ratchet (`built > 90`) both identified a
  synthesised edge by its SHAPE — "the last segment appears in `names`" — which
  also matches the hand-written `from .tools.index_repo import index_repo`. This
  repo has **113** of those, already resolving, so **the ratchet passed against
  the reintroduced defect and the number was 6x high**. Compare against the
  import statements actually WRITTEN in the file. [[a-ratchet-can-pass-against-the-defect-it-names]]
- **A fix for a false positive can install a false negative, and only the
  non-vacuity pass sees it.** 09-01 (#569): the runtime-discovery scanner asked
  whether `__path__` appeared in the enumeration call.
  `pkgutil.iter_modules(schemas_pkg.__path__)` in a TEST file is ANOTHER
  package's search path, so the test directory read as self-enumerating and
  **502 files went live**, suppressing every real finding under `tests/` — with
  every assertion in the new test file still green. ⚠ **Suppression has no
  symptom**: the false positives it was written to remove were gone, which is
  what success looks like. Ask what the fix makes INVISIBLE, and write that test
  before the one that proves it works. [[a-set-cannot-count]]
- **Capping a report does not cap the tool that ACTS on it.** 09-01 (#566): the
  same absence claim reached `check_delete_safe` down a different branch — its
  "no refs at all" fallback returns `safe_to_delete` **regardless of** the
  dead-code confidence it had just consulted, then floors that verdict at 0.85.
  ⚠ **Grep the consumers of a number you just made more honest and check they
  read it on every path**, not just the one the fix touched. A destructive
  recommendation is the surface that matters, and it was reading a signal it
  also had permission to ignore.
- **A number that reproduces on one box is reproducible on one box.** 09-03
  (harness F-13): the token benchmark was deterministic on this machine AND
  on CI and disagreed by 2.5% between them, for three causes at once — a CRLF
  checkout, ranking ties broken by `os.walk` order (NTFS vs ext4), and a
  `_meta` counter read from HOME. **Capture a published reference where the
  gate runs, and diff per-row, never per-total** — the total hid one cause
  behind another. ⚠ And `uv run --python X` REBUILDS `.venv` without the
  extras; the fast tier ran 1055/112-skipped at exit 0 minutes later. The
  fast tier has a skip ceiling now. [[pipes-and-missing-xdist-both-report-exit-zero]]
- **A competitor's fix list is a free defect probe.** 08-22: a rival's
  `fix(gini): measure a file's lines as its own span, not the sum of every node`
  named our defect precisely enough to confirm in one query —
  `get_architecture_metrics` summed `byte_length` over nested symbols, inflating
  byte mass 33.4% overall and up to 2.28x per file. Read their commit TITLES
  against whatever we built the same way; it is minutes, and it finds what our
  own tests were written not to see. See CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`.
- **A frozen version string cannot say whether a running process serves current
  code.** 08-31 (rotated out of Current State with 1.108.313): `__version__` is
  `importlib.metadata`, fixed at install time and never read from the tree, so
  the source-drift verdict **false-alarmed forever on an editable install** (the
  module IS the tree) and was **blind to the copied install**, which was the
  actual incident. Every process on a source install reports the same number, so
  the answer comes from `started_at` vs source mtime instead — it caught that
  session's own server on the first run. ⚠ **Ownership and freshness are
  different properties**: `verify_package_integrity()` asks which distribution
  the running module came from and would certify a fourteen-release-old install.
  [[grep-a-persisted-field-for-its-readers]]
- **A gate's exit status is never the left side of a pipe.** 09-04
  (inbound item 6): `python gate.py ... | tee out; rc=$?` records tee's status
  under Actions' default `bash -e`, so every decline the pre-flight computed
  was ignored and the model would have run. The reviewer named one site; the
  ratchet (`test_no_pipe_hides_a_gate_exit_status`) found four more across
  the stack. ⚠ **Its first draft matched per PHYSICAL line and stayed green
  with the pipe back**, because the invocation and `| tee` sat on different
  `\`-continued lines; normalise the text the way the shell does before
  scanning it. [[a-trailing-command-hides-pytests-exit-code]]
- **A default argument bound at import pins the wrong repo.** 09-04 (inbound
  items 5 and 6): `def f(cwd: Path = ROOT)` captured the module's own
  checkout at `def`, so a test that patched `ROOT` to a scratch repo still
  ran git in `C:\MCPs\jcodemunch-mcp`; bit twice in one afternoon and only
  the end-to-end arm saw it. Default to `None`, resolve at call time.

## Issue + release policy (2026-07-28)

⚠⚠ **The forensics behind every rule here are in `ISSUE-HISTORY.md` §
"issue + release policy forensics (2026-08-28)" — measurements, dates and the
incidents that produced each one. READ THEM BEFORE ARGUING WITH A POLICY.**
Several were written after we broke them ourselves; 2e is recorded in the first
person because the wrong call sounded reasonable at the time.

**1. One issue, one verdict.** A multi-finding report gets SPLIT at triage into
one issue per finding, cross-linked, credit on each. Nothing is dropped and no
detail is discouraged. The reason is closure mechanics: a 4-finding issue closes
only when the last one settles, so three finished fixes sit behind one
unfinished conversation. ⚠ This corrects a mistake we made deliberately —
consolidating five jdoc issues into one gate cut the open count from 5 to 1 and
manufactured a single artifact with the power to block a release.
**Tracker-tidiness and granularity pull in opposite directions; do not optimize
the count.**

**2. A release is NEVER blocked on an open issue**, including a verification we
asked for. Done + tested + green ships on schedule, carrying a plain-language
verification-status line. Late re-verification counts IN FULL and is announced
retroactively. Nothing expires. **Every timebox names its default action** ("verification
by X, or Y ships with disclosure Z"); a date with no stated consequence is a wish.
⚠ **The point is that a reviewer's thoroughness must never become a veto.** If
being careful can stall a release, careful review becomes expensive to accept.

**2e. NEVER BATCH OUR RELEASE BEHIND SOMEONE ELSE'S CLOCK** (jjg, 2026-08-18,
after it happened). ⚠⚠ **Policy 2 does not get broken by someone overruling it —
it gets broken by an apparently sensible batching argument that never mentions
it.** I once recommended holding five merged, green, user-facing fixes for two
days so a release could absorb a contributor's CLA-blocked PR and save three
conflict resolutions. jjg accepted it. That coupled our schedule to a
contributor's signature, which is exactly what policy 2 exists to prevent — and
it was wrong on the merits, because batching reduces the NUMBER of resolutions,
not whether they happen, and each is minutes.
⚠ **The test, before proposing to hold a release:** name the thing being waited
for, and whether it is OURS. If it is anyone else's action — a signature, a PR, a
reply, a re-run — ship now and let them ride the next one.
⚠ **Corollary: "reduce OUR churn" is not a release criterion.** Conflict
resolution and re-merges are our costs to absorb. The moment avoiding them shapes
WHEN users get fixes, the optimisation has inverted.
⚠ **The timeboxes are NOT the problem and must not be "fixed".** Every one names
a default that ships the work regardless. If a window appears to block a release,
the batching decision is what is blocking it. [[never-batch-a-release-behind-someone-elses-clock]]

**2f. THE ONE CASE WHERE NOT CUTTING A RELEASE IS LEGAL — and it is narrow**
(jjg, 2026-08-20). ⚠⚠ **THE DISCRIMINATOR IS WHETHER A USER IS WAITING FOR
ANYTHING IN THE BLOCK.** A block that is entirely metadata for one named
recipient is the only shape this covers, because shipping it gets no user
anything. ⚠ The asymmetry that decides it: **released metadata is PERMANENT per
version, unreleased metadata is FREE** — the same immutability argument that
justifies deciding fast, pointing the other way at the release step.
⚠⚠ **THE TEST, applied every time before invoking 2f: name what is in the block
and who is waiting for it. If ANY entry is a fix, a feature or a correctness
change, 2f does not apply and 2e governs — cut it now.**
⚠ A held release with no trigger is a forgotten release, so record the hold in
Current State, not only here. [[declining-to-cut-is-not-holding-a-fix]]

**3. A contributor's PR is never the only path.** Timebox it and keep our own
path warm (#388 taught this the expensive way).

**3a. NO TIMEBOX WE OFFER RUNS LONGER THAN 24 HOURS** (jjg, 2026-08-14, widened
same day; **made ABSOLUTE 2026-08-20 — "Not again. 24 hour. Tops. Ever."**). It
covers every shape: signing the CLA, opening a PR already written, taking an
issue to implement.
⚠⚠ **The window is only fair BECAUSE the default action preserves credit.** At
expiry we implement it ourselves and credit them in the CHANGELOG, the release
notes and the close comment. So the 24 hours decide whose COMMIT it is, never
whether they are credited and never whether the fix ships. **Quote the default in
the same comment as the deadline** — a clock with an unstated consequence reads
as a threat.
⚠⚠ **The failure mode has a name: a CLA hostage negotiation.** #443 went eight
days — a real security fix, reviewed and green, held behind a 30-second form,
while seven of our own merges conflicted its branch. **A window longer than 24
hours purchases exactly one thing: the chance the contributor's commit is theirs
— and it pays for that chance in the user's exposure to an unfixed defect.**
⚠ An extension the contributor ASKS FOR is different from a default we hand out;
CONTRIBUTING.md invites the ask. Hold it when they ask.
⚠ **Do not shorten a timebox already posted**, and **re-read the thread for the
operative date — never quote one from here or from memory.** A thread can carry
two. The grandfathering clause is spent and must not be revived.
[[re-read-the-thread-for-the-operative-timebox]] [[timebox-comments-state-deadline-and-default-only]]

**3b. A MERGEABLE contributor PR merges BEFORE any changelog-touching work of
our own** (jjg, 2026-08-14), including a release commit.

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh pr list --state open --json number,author,mergeable,mergeStateStatus \
  --jq '.[] | select(.author.login != "jgravelle") | "#\(.number) \(.author.login) \(.mergeable) \(.mergeStateStatus)"'
```

Any row reading `MERGEABLE CLEAN` goes in before ours. ⚠⚠ The reason is
mechanical: our `[Unreleased]` edits land in the same block a contributor's entry
occupies, so each of our merges conflicts their branch, and **a CONFLICTING fork
PR has no `refs/pull/N/merge` and therefore gets NO CI AT ALL** — their branch
goes dark for a reason unrelated to their change. Measured: #443 conflicted FIVE
TIMES IN ONE DAY, which is one wrong merge order repeated, not five incidents.
⚠ **The boundary:** a BLOCKED PR cannot go first. Then we ship anyway (policy 2)
and **we own the resolution** — push the merge to their branch and say on the
thread that the conflict was ours. **This rule governs ORDER when we have a
choice; it never holds our work behind someone else's form.**
⚠⚠ **Do NOT answer "an issue is stuck" with aggregate stats.** jcm's median
time-to-close is 0 days; that is TRUE and it is NOT a response. The cost of a
blocked issue is CONCENTRATED, not distributed. Design the fix at the OUTLIER.
[[feedback_dont_answer_pain_with_aggregates]] [[push-to-the-fork-remote-by-name]]

**3c. PROFILE THE AUTHOR BEFORE REVIEWING A VENDOR-SHAPED PR** (jjg,
2026-08-17). Any PR adding a named third-party provider, gateway, SDK or endpoint
gets three queries FIRST, before a line of the diff is read:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api users/<login> --jq '"created=\(.created_at[0:10]) repos=\(.public_repos) company=\(.company) bio=\(.bio)"'
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api "search/issues?q=is:pr+author:<login>&per_page=1" --jq .total_count
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api "search/issues?q=is:pr+author:<login>+<vendor>+in:title&per_page=1" --jq .total_count
```

⚠⚠ **The discriminator is the RATIO, not the volume.** #485's author had 3,089
PRs, 2,242 with "minimax" in the title (73%), ~19/day. Found in under a minute;
the PR had been reviewed in depth twice before anyone looked.
⚠ Also check whether we have a DEMAND signal, the actual #380 bar:
`gh api "search/issues?q=repo:jgravelle/jcodemunch-mcp+<vendor>"`.
⚠⚠ **Quality is NOT the discriminator and must not be used as one.** #485's diff
was better than most human PRs. **Good work aimed at something nobody asked for
is still something nobody asked for.** Close on demand, credit the finding, and
say plainly that quality was not the reason.
⚠ Do not assert employment you cannot prove — state the numbers and ask.
⚠ **A posted timebox's default can be RETRACTED IN THE OPEN when the facts
change, but never silently.** [[profile-the-author-before-reviewing-a-vendor-pr]]

**3d. `license/cla` IS A REQUIRED STATUS CHECK ON THE DEFAULT BRANCH OF ALL
THREE REPOS** (jjg, 2026-08-17 for jcm; suite-wide 2026-08-21). ⚠⚠ **A setting
fixed in one repo of a suite is fixed in one repo** — for four days jdoc required
nothing and jdata had no protection at all.

```bash
for r in jcodemunch-mcp:main jdocmunch-mcp:master jdatamunch-mcp:master; do
  GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api "repos/jgravelle/${r%%:*}/branches/${r##*:}/protection" \
    --jq '{contexts:.required_status_checks.contexts, strict:.required_status_checks.strict, enforce_admins:.enforce_admins.enabled}'
done
```

⚠ `enforce_admins: false` and `strict: false` are both deliberate: the admin
override lets jjg land a merge pushed to a contributor's fork, and `strict` would
force a rebase after every release.
⚠⚠ **NOTHING IS ERASED — `license/cla` is a legacy commit STATUS, not a check
run.** Every other check is a check-run that GitHub re-runs per head; a legacy
status is posted to ONE SHA, so a new commit starts with zero of them. The old
head keeps its status and the signature (stored per ACCOUNT at cla-assistant.io)
was never in question. **The gate cannot tell "not signed" from "not reported",
so it fails closed to `BLOCKED` for both. Absent still means DO NOT MERGE — but
the remedy is to get a status posted on the current head, never to re-verify an
agreement that did not change.**

```bash
# count=0 means NOT SIGNED or NOT REPORTED. Never merge on absence.
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api "repos/jgravelle/<repo>/commits/<head-sha>/status" --jq '"state=\(.state) count=\(.statuses|length)"'
```

⚠⚠ **THE RE-TRIGGER IS OURS — no contributor action, ~25 seconds.** The status
comes from a repo WEBHOOK to cla-assistant.io on `pull_request`, not an in-repo
workflow. A delivery can arrive, answer `200 OK`, and post nothing; redelivering
that same event makes it post.

```bash
HID=$(GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api repos/jgravelle/<repo>/hooks --jq '.[0].id')
# ⚠ jq mangles delivery ids (past float precision) — read them with python.
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api "repos/jgravelle/<repo>/hooks/$HID/deliveries?per_page=15" > dv.json
python -c "import json;[print(x['delivered_at'][5:16],x['event']+'/'+str(x.get('action')),x['status_code'],x['id']) for x in json.load(open('dv.json'))[:8]]"
GITHUB_TOKEN="" gh api --method POST "repos/jgravelle/<repo>/hooks/$HID/deliveries/<exact-id>/attempts"
```

⚠ Diagnose first — a delivery that never arrived is a different problem from one
that arrived and did nothing. ⚠ CLA Assistant can also fail to fire on PR OPEN,
which reads identically and has the opposite cause; check comments as well as
statuses. ⚠ Our own push to their branch is a `synchronize` and provokes a
missing status.
⚠⚠ **NEVER POST THE STATUS OURSELVES.** We hold admin and the Status API would
clear the gate in one call. `license/cla` is a legal assertion about an
agreement, and a maintainer-authored `success` is a forged one —
indistinguishable from the genuine article afterwards. **Redelivering makes CLA
Assistant reach its OWN verdict, which is the whole difference.**
⚠ It does NOT solve vendor time-wasting and must not be sold as if it does;
signing costs a campaign nothing. Legal exposure and spam are different problems.
[[a-push-reprovokes-a-missing-cla-status]] [[org-forks-cannot-be-pushed-to]]

Surfaces: `CONTRIBUTING.md` ("One issue, one verdict" + "A release is never
blocked on an open issue") and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
⚠ **CONTRIBUTING.md is IDENTICAL suite-wide** (differing only by product name,
repo slug, and jcm's quality-gates section). Two pre-existing bugs fell out of
normalizing it: the documented `pip install -e ".[test]"` was WRONG IN ALL THREE
REPOS (no repo declares a `test` extra; dev deps are a PEP 735
`[dependency-groups]` block), and jcm's `README.md#license-dual-use` anchor
pointed at a heading that does not exist. ⚠ **CI installs with `uv sync` and
never runs the command the docs give a human**, which is why it survived: the
thing we test is not the thing they do.
## Registry verification reads a NESTED row (2026-08-27)

⚠⚠ **The MCP registry API nests each row as `{server: {...}, _meta: {...}}`**
(schema `2025-12-11`): `name`, `version`, `packages[]` under `server`;
`isLatest`, `publishedAt` under `_meta["io.modelcontextprotocol.registry/official"]`.
**A flat `row["name"]` read returns ZERO rows on a publish that completely
succeeded**, and unlike the paging trap it SURVIVES `&limit=100`. **Never
re-publish on a zero-row read; fix the parse.** Confirm
`server.packages[].version` advanced, not only `server.version`.
`scripts/registry_verify.py` is the parse (`release.yml` runs it; the
2026-08-27 measurements are in `ISSUE-HISTORY.md`).

⚠⚠ **THE PUBLISH LINE IS HANDED OVER IN cmd.exe FORM. ONE FORM, NO MENU.**
jjg is NEVER at a Bash prompt (stated flatly 2026-09-02). Literal paths only:
no `~`, no `%USERPROFILE%`, no `$env:USERPROFILE`. The `!` prefix runs Git
Bash and that is not the rule: **a mechanism is not a habit.** A line that
must run through `!` is a tool call to make, not a paste to hand over.

```
cd /d C:\MCPs\jcodemunch-mcp && "C:\Users\j\mcp-publisher.exe" login github && "C:\Users\j\mcp-publisher.exe" publish
```

⚠ The release skill (`.claude/skills/release/SKILL.md`) is TRACKED in this
repo since 2026-09-04 (DESIGN D1/D2); its publish half is superseded by
`release.yml` and says so at the top. Until then it was gitignored and every
correction to it was machine-local, which is why the rules above live here.

## Reproducing CI's environment (release step 2c)

⚠ The full tier (`uv run python -m harness full`) is the command now; this
block stays because `tests/test_ci_env_reproduce_command.py` binds it to
`pr-gate.yml`'s install line, and because the lesson below is the one that
made the tier necessary.

```bash
uv sync --locked --group dev --extra watch --python 3.13
uv run --python 3.13 pytest tests/ -q
```

⚠⚠ **Step 2c read `uv run --python 3.13 python -m pytest tests/ -q` until
2026-08-28 and NEVER built CI's environment** — no `--extra watch`, no
dev-group sync. It only looked correct while `.venv` happened to carry the
extras from an earlier sync, i.e. **the command was inheriting a state it did
not create**. CI (`pr-gate.yml`, formerly `test.yml`) runs `uv sync --locked --group dev --extra watch` first.

⚠⚠ **Caught mid-release, and the near-miss is the lesson: it returned EXIT 0
and the totals reconciled EXACTLY** (8,740 + 18 new tests = 8,758) — the two
things "green" normally means here. Meanwhile `passed` fell 8,721 → 8,634 and
`skipped` rose **19 → 124**: 105 tests silently did not execute, because
`watchfiles` (the `[watch]` extra CI installs BY NAME) was absent.

⚠ **READ THE SKIP COUNT, not just the exit code and the total.** Expect the
documented 19–26 range; a jump means the environment, not the code. The
before/after delta on the SAME job is the only signal.

⚠ Third instance of one family, and CONTRIBUTING.md already carries the
sentence: *CI installs with `uv sync` and never runs the command the docs give a
human, so the thing we test is not the thing they do.* The first was
`pip install -e ".[test]"` (an extra no repo declares); the second was
`-n 4 --dist loadfile` under a bare `python -m pytest`, which collects nothing
and exits 0. [[pipes-and-missing-xdist-both-report-exit-zero]]

## Maintenance Practices

1. **Document every tool before shipping.** Any PR adding a new tool to `server.py`
   must simultaneously update: README.md (tool reference), CLAUDE.md (Key Files),
   CHANGELOG.md, and at least one test.
2. **Log every silent exception.** Every `except Exception:` block must emit at
   minimum `logger.debug("...", exc_info=True)`. For user-facing fallbacks (AI
   summarizer, index load), use `logger.warning(...)`.
3. **CHANGELOG.md** is the authoritative version history — update it with every release.
4. **Never hand-type a jCodeMunch benchmark number.** The comparison harnesses
   (`run_rag_baseline.py`, `run_odysseus_compare.py`) read
   `benchmarks/jcm_reference.json`, written by `run_benchmark.py --reference`.
   ⚠ **The failure this closes was invisible for four months:** our side was a
   2026-03-28 constant while the other side of every ratio was re-measured each
   run, so published ratios drifted on their own. Re-measuring moved all three
   per-repo figures AGAINST us and flipped a published winner (gin: `jcm 1.2x
   leaner` → `RAG 1.1x leaner`). ⚠ **A repo outside the artifact renders "not
   measured" — there is deliberately no estimator.** The removed one allocated
   our cost proportionally to repo size, i.e. it assumed the opposite of what we
   claim. `tests/test_benchmark_reference.py` fails on a returning `JCODEMUNCH_*`
   constant and asserts the estimator absent BY NAME. ⚠ **FOUR artifacts mirror
   one run** — `results.md`, `METHODOLOGY.md`, README, and
   `benchmarks/provenance/measured.json`. Re-syncing three and missing the
   fourth failed `test_provenance.py`, **inside the known 12 local-ONNX env
   failures**. `--reference` now rewrites the provenance block itself; two
   committed artifacts disagreeing is the same defect in a different costume.
   ⚠ **v1.108.222: the corpus is PINNED by upstream commit** in
   `benchmarks/tasks.json`, and `--reference` refuses to publish a number
   measured against an unpinned, drifted, or unknown-completeness corpus. **A
   fifth artifact now mirrors the run: `benchmarks/REPRODUCING.md`**, and a test
   fails if it does not name every pinned SHA. ⚠ **Never state a repo's file
   count as a property of the repo** — it is a property of the INSTALLATION
   (grammar pack, size limits, skip patterns), which is the whole point of the
   .221 capability certificate. Say which commit, and let the count live in the
   artifact beside the SHA that produced it.
5. **Rotate, never delete — and the budget is the WHOLE FILE, not one section.**
   `Current State` keeps the 3 newest releases and the `Tests:` line keeps the same
   three; closed dated entries go to `ISSUE-HISTORY.md`, which no session loads.
   `tests/test_claude_md_size.py` is the gate.
   ⚠⚠ **The prose version of this rule was followed and the file broke anyway.**
   On 2026-08-21 CLAUDE.md hit 200,543 chars and the harness refused to load it,
   while `Current State` — the only section this practice named — was 14% of it.
   The growth was in dated issue history (82k) and a `Tests:` line carrying
   per-release counts back to 1.108.268 (16k). **A rule that names one section
   licenses every other section to grow.**
   ⚠ When an entry rotates out, ask what LESSON it earned and put that one line in
   **Standing lessons** with its date. An entry with no reusable lesson needs no
   line; an entry whose lesson is already there needs no second one.
   ⚠⚠ **MEASURE THE SECTIONS BEFORE CHOOSING WHAT TO ROTATE — the answer has
   twice been a section nobody suspected.** On 2026-08-28 at 139,184/140,000 I
   proposed rotating **Standing lessons** and was wrong: it was 6.4% of the
   file, where **Key Files was 40.1% (55,643 chars)** and the issue/release
   policy 15.4%. Rotating what I proposed would have recovered almost nothing.
   Split by heading and sort by size first; it is one script and it settles it.
   ⚠ **Key Files at 40% is the NEXT rotation target and the hardest**, because
   it is also the most load-bearing — the per-file ⚠⚠ warnings are what stop a
   defect recurring. Rotate its dated INCIDENT prose, never its rules.
   ⚠⚠ **SPLIT 2026-08-29, and the axis is the reusable part: WHAT IS DERIVABLE
   LEAVES, WHAT IS NOT STAYS.** Key Files was 61,593 chars (44.4%) and the file
   was at 139,531/140,000 with 469 characters of room. The descriptive half --
   what each module IS -- moved to `KEY-FILES.md`, which no session loads,
   because **jcodemunch answers it live** (`get_file_outline`, `get_repo_outline`).
   Nothing answers "this cache is evicted on every write, so it is not a cache",
   so every invariant stayed. **76 entries moved, 44 stayed, 120,344 chars (86.0%).**
   ⚠⚠ **The `⚠` marker is a PROXY for load-bearing and it over-cut by 15.**
   `producers.py`, `receipts.py`, `runtime/confidence.py` and twelve others carry
   rationale with no marker on it -- a prohibition, a constraint whose violation
   causes a defect, a "because". They are named in `RATIONALE_ENTRIES` in
   `tests/test_key_files_split.py`, and **adding a name there to buy budget is
   the thing the split exists to stop.**
   ⚠⚠ **`@path` imports DO NOT WORK for this** -- they are expanded at launch, so
   a split into imports recovers exactly nothing. Verified against the docs
   before choosing, and it is the obvious wrong answer. Nested `CLAUDE.md` and
   `.claude/rules/` both load ON READ, and **this project routes exploration
   through MCP tools and `sed`/`cat`, neither of which triggers it** -- so the
   mechanism that looks purpose-built would have loaded nothing here.
   ⚠⚠ **SPLIT AGAIN 2026-08-31, same axis, and the marker under-selected AGAIN.**
   `CLI Subcommands` (8,367) + `Env Vars` (13,097) were 16.6% of the budget and
   went to `CLI-AND-ENV.md`: **69 rows moved, 27 stayed, 129,052 -> 121,580 chars
   on the SETTLED tree** (headroom 10,948 -> 18,420; the rows are -8,718 and
   documenting the split cost 1,160 back). `--help` and `jcodemunch-mcp config` derive the
   moved half live. **The ⚠ marker found 9 of the 27 keepers; the other 18 were
   read by hand** and carry a prohibition (`JCODEMUNCH_RUNTIME_REDACT`: never on
   production traces), a belief-correcting constraint (`JCODEMUNCH_PERF_TELEMETRY`:
   the ring is ALWAYS tracked) or a rationale with no marker on it. They are named
   in `CLI_RATIONALE`/`ENV_RATIONALE` in `tests/test_cli_env_split.py`; **adding a
   name there to buy budget is the thing the split exists to stop.** ⚠ Its "in
   neither" direction is DELIBERATELY one-sided — 37 `JCODEMUNCH_*` names and 12
   `add_parser` names are legitimately in neither table, so it asserts only that a
   DOCUMENTED row still resolves in `src/`. ⚠ `CONFIGURATION.md` already documents
   18 of these variables in prose; that overlap predates the split and is NOT
   resolved by it.
   ⚠ The ratchet asserts each entry lives in EXACTLY ONE file. Its first run
   caught its own defect: keying entries by BASENAME collapsed `runtime/redact.py`
   with `redact.py` and `runtime/confidence.py` with `retrieval/confidence.py`,
   reporting a duplication that did not exist. **A name is not an identity**, the
   Rust-fidelity lesson, reproduced inside the guard written to prevent drift.
   ⚠⚠ **THE SPLIT TARGET MUST BE TRACKED, AND `docs/` IS NOT** -- `.gitignore:83`
   is `docs/*`. The first version of this wrote `docs/KEY-FILES.md`, which would
   have made 76 entries MACHINE-LOCAL: not in git, not in CI, gone on a fresh
   checkout, exactly the gitignored-skill trap this file already warns about.
   **It surfaced only because `git status` did not list the new file.** Check
   `git check-ignore` on any path a rotation writes to; creating the file proves
   nothing. It lives at the repo root beside the other shipped docs, and
   `ALLOWED_ROOT_FILES` names it in both directions.
   ⚠⚠ **MEASURED 2026-08-28: Key Files has almost NO rotatable narrative left.**
   A scan of its 119 entries found FOUR provenance clauses (1,713 chars), three
   of them rules; Standing lessons and Current State each duplicate NOTHING from
   it. **It is 42% of the file because it is 119 modules of non-redundant
   invariants, not because it is padded** — so documenting one release under
   Practice 1 cost more than a full rotation pass recovered. **The next lever is
   a SPLIT and it is jjg's call.** Do not raise `BUDGET` (the gate says its 10k
   buffer is the last one) and do not buy room by deleting ⚠⚠ rules.
   ⚠ The 2026-08-28 pass took the issue/release policy from 21,448 to 12,391 by
   keeping every rule, every operational command and every prohibition, and
   moving only the forensics — verified by asserting all nine policy numbers,
   six commands and seven prohibitions still resolve. **Write that check as a
   script; a rotation reviewed by eye is how a command goes missing.**
6. **A CI step that produces a PUBLIC verdict is product surface — test its text.**
   `tests/test_health_radar_action.py` opened by asserting that the Action's shell
   and YAML steps "can only be exercised by running the Action in a real CI
   environment", and under that exemption
   `git fetch origin "$BASE" --depth=1` sat unread in the base-checkout step.
   ⚠ **`--depth=1` does not merely limit a download — against an already complete
   clone it SHORTENS it**, writing `.git/shallow`. `churn_surface` is
   `complexity x log(1 + churn)` with churn counted by `git log --since=<N> days
   ago`, so the base saw ONE commit, scored every file at churn <= 1, and came
   back artificially healthy. ⚠⚠ **Measured 2026-08-10 at a single commit,
   identical tree hash both sides: shallow 82.2 (B), full 75.5 (C), and
   `churn_surface` the only axis that moved.** The same commit graded B against
   itself. Every PR was charged for the gap, publicly, on the contributor's own
   thread. **Cannot execute it is not cannot check it** — the guard that closes
   this reads step text, which is weaker than running the Action and is still
   exactly what was missing.
7. **`confidence` is certainty language; ship a stop rule beside it.** A score
   says how sure we are, which invites the caller to go get surer.
   `tools/_stop_rule.py` answers the other question: can anything make it surer?
   ⚠ **`terminal` means FINAL, not SAFE** — a blocking verdict is terminal too.
   ⚠⚠ **A false `terminal: true` on a destructive action is the worst error this
   contract can make**, so every uncertainty resolves to False, including an
   unrecognised verdict. Motivated by arXiv 2608.01347, which measures
   verification loops as a distinct TOOL-borne waste carrier: the highest
   redundant-verification runs cost 18x the clean-run median and 2.5x the tool
   calls at no success gain. ⚠ `already_consulted` lives in the tool
   DESCRIPTION, not the response, because it is static per call and the
   description is cached — the same fixed-prefix versus per-turn split that
   paper measures. That makes it prose nobody diffs, so `test_stop_rule.py`
   binds it to real import sites and fails if a tool stops calling what we
   claim it consulted.
8. **A test must never read or write the developer's real global config.**
   `load_config()` with no `storage_path` resolves to `CODE_INDEX_PATH` or
   `~/.code-index/config.jsonc`, reads it, and with the default
   `create_missing=True` WRITES it when absent. ⚠⚠ **conftest's
   `_reset_global_config` already guarded this and already cited #411; a bare
   `load_config()` in a fixture runs AFTER that reset and re-pulls the real config
   straight past it.** The guard existed and the call sites walked around it, which
   is why `tests/test_config_isolation_guard.py` checks the CALL, not the reset.
   ⚠ **The write half is the worse half:** on a storage dir that looks like an
   existing install (any `.db`) with no config file, the config a test run creates
   has `tool_surface` ABSENT, resolving to `full`, and `_fresh_config_content` is
   explicit that `upgrade_config` can never back-inject it. A test run could pin a
   user to a surface nothing migrates them off. Found as three failures @lilubot
   hit on PR #433 and reasonably blamed on their own machine (#437). Our suite was
   green because this box has `max_folder_files` commented out, CI green because
   the runner has no config at all. **A test that passes on two machines and fails
   on a third, for a reason none of the three can see, is the defect.**
9. **When a fix turns an OLD test red, check whether that test was encoding the
   defect before "fixing" the code back.** Four instances in one release cycle
   (2026-08-18/19): `test_generate_full_snippet` required EVERY canonical tool
   name to appear in the guide, so it could only pass while #495 existed;
   `test_embed_drift` pinned a literal error wording, which is how that site kept
   a stale copy through #489; `test_full_surface_still_honours_profile` asserted
   equality with the baked `_PROFILE_TIERS`, which is #507's premise; and two of
   my own in #489 asserted on the CONSTANT rather than the call site, so they
   checked the fix instead of the site.
   ⚠ **The tell is that the test states the mechanism rather than the outcome.**
   "every canonical name appears", "equals the tier table", "the message is this
   string" are all restatements of an implementation. "what it advertises is what
   it will dispatch" is the property. ⚠ A red suite invites fixing the tests; run
   the non-vacuity pass on the OLD test too — if it passes only against the
   pre-fix tree, it was the defect's witness, not its guard.
10. **Run the touched test files BEFORE the full suite** (jjg, 2026-08-28). The
   suite is a RELEASE gate, not an edit loop. Measured on #558: full suite 12:55
   (6 failures) -> fix -> 10:47 -> CI 9:21 = **33 minutes of blocking wait**,
   where `pytest` on the three affected files reproduces all six failures in
   **3 seconds**. Order: touched files, then `uv run ruff check src/` (it catches
   the syntax class without running anything), then the suite once as the gate.
   ⚠ **The exception is narrow: a change whose blast radius cannot be named** —
   a shared primitive like `PARSER_GENERATION`, a store schema, a skip-list
   constant reaches files no import graph predicts, and there the suite IS the
   first check. Say which case applies; `get_blast_radius` answers it directly.
   ⚠⚠ **APPENDED as 10, not inserted at 8 where it fits by topic.** The first
   attempt slotted it beside the other testing practices and renumbered the two
   below it, which silently broke live cross-references in
   `tests/test_build_tree_spellings.py`, `tests/test_hook_steering_fixes.py`
   and `tests/test_hardening.py`, plus dated CHANGELOG and ISSUE-HISTORY
   entries that were correct when written. **These numbers are an index, not a
   ranking, and nothing fails a build when one drifts** — so a new practice
   goes on the END.
   ⚠ **Measure a wait, never estimate it.** I reported this as "two suite runs,
   that's the whole 40 minutes"; 2x13 is 26, and jjg did the arithmetic.
11. **A release does not end at the registry — reinstall and RESTART locally**
   (2026-08-29). We develop jcodemunch using jcodemunch, and this box ran
   **1.108.293 against a 1.108.307 tree: fourteen releases, six days.** The
   checklist's eight steps are complete with respect to USERS and silent with
   respect to US. ⚠⚠ **`verify_package_integrity()` cannot see this and is not
   meant to** — it asks whether the running module is from the OFFICIAL
   distribution and would certify a fourteen-release-old install. **Ownership
   and freshness are different properties**, and a check that inspects the
   distribution made it feel covered. ⚠⚠ **The subtler tell: the verification
   path routed AROUND the product** — every fix that week was checked with
   `PYTHONPATH=src` rather than through the server, and nobody decided that.
   ⚠ `install-status` reports `source_drift` now (tri-state; UNKNOWN never
   `False`), and all five packages are EDITABLE, so only the restart can drift.
   `scripts/repair-munch-installs.ps1` repairs it and refuses while a server runs.
