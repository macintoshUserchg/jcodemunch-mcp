"""Trend tracking over results/history.jsonl (docs/competitive/DESIGN.md s6;
the brief's Phase 3 item 4): the summary's *Movement* section.

purpose:  say, per (axis, tool, corpus) row, how the gap to jcm moved
          between this run, the previous one and the first one, with the
          competitor's release on each of the three runs beside it, so a
          movement that coincides with their release is visible without
          being attributed; and name a row whose jcm value moved while the
          competitor's release did not as OUR regression or improvement
invokes:  nothing outside the process: history.jsonl's lines (one per
          recorded run: medians, and from PR 3b on, bands) and the current
          result's rows
produces: `movement(history, current)`: one record per row of the current
          run, and `render()` the markdown section run.py appends
refuses:  to classify a movement without a band on the current run (a
          history line older than this module carries medians only: the
          row says `no band recorded` instead of inventing one)
pinned:   nothing of its own; the history file is append-only under
          `--record` and every line names its jcm commit and the pins
fairness: the gap is measured minus jcm in the axis's own units, the same
          quantity the band judges; `flipped` is a sign change of that gap,
          `widened`/`narrowed` its magnitude, `unchanged` within the band.
          A competitor's release beside a movement is a fact, never a
          cause; the section says so in its header line.
